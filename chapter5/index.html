Edwin started playing his plates. He lifted one plate in right shouder up with his magic Force. Under the plate, he wore a shirt, only lightly covering his tattoos on the skins. In fact, each plate had each tattoo as ruin on the skin. That’s why he could take off and arm his plates so swiftly. His armor isn’t nessesary powered gear, but it is robust, polished, enhanced by his power. When he took the armor off, the armor became a cube. In this world, there wasn’t so much thing to do with gears, for every material is just material. Power comes from the user, spirits and skills. He wore them because he loves the appearance. So frequently he switched his “suits” if the armor wasn’t a right fit. Edwin’s newsest armor is shined with golden colour. </p>
<p>“He took so long time. Is he in trouble? “ He worried as he thought. “But, man, he’s nearly invincible regarding damages… I doubt anyone can hurt him. “</p>
<p>“This monk a ‘tank’, a unlimited container. “</p>
<p>“But there is no reason to take that long. “</p>
<p>He really wanted to come in the Zone then help, but he couldn’t, for this was a great risk. Anyone can strike him from behind. And he has no eyesights inside the Zone. No eyesights no damage. There wasn’t a sign for him to even just light a candle with his endless magicforce, for the darkness was controlled by warlock’s magic, but not due to nature. Despite wearing the plates, strike from behind could be deadly for the big “cannon” Edwin. After all, though a cannon is strong enough destroying any target, it is not a tank which endures. Until then, he knew nothing inside the Zone. He cannot read the airs. So he kept waiting for right moment. The plan was for Rudi to turn off the switch of the Zone, such that he could see. </p>
<p>Now he was starting reading the tome on his waistbelt. That was gold and quartz texture -not only embedded- on the cover. It was a accessory, but more than a decoration. Like paladin and priest who chain a holy Bible on the waistbelt, he wore it, more elegantly and sumptuously. But this is not a holy bible. </p>
<p>“The girl was sensitive. When I hug her, she got wet, like a swamp in desert. And I kissed her like rains in oasis. Her nipples were nice, soft and pinkish red, hardened as I landed my tongue onto it, where I can lick for all night. They were all sensitive and cute. My caress is in every inch of her silky milky skin. “</p>
<p>He read what he narrated in the past with flatiron magic. No actual “pages” in his tome. All the written characters on page were all inked as such. Despite all magic, a layperson without knowledge of magic could also easily flip over “page” by page. He didn’t name the name of the tome. But you can call it diary of love and romance, although, to him, indeed it could be more important than Holy Bible. As he said, Cute girls are my energy, And you know nothing about my energy. The F&amp;F- his fire and force. </p>
<p>Already for an hour been waiting, “even if he died, I need carry his body. No reason for waiting even longer. “ he warmed up his blood a bit with the magic, and lit his ring on his right hand as his magical lamp. The force by him lifted his feet a bit onto the air, accelerating. He “walked” toward the corner, near and near. At certain point, however, the kindle on the ring couldn’t be seen, as if all the photons were absorbed by multiple black bodies. He feareth the darkness, for he anticipated the risk. They might all die. </p>
<p>“Shit. But I have to come thru the fear.” The environment put irrefutable fear, stress, and pressure on any creature getting near. The nearer, the more intense, that apparently no one can bear, for this is the intuition of creatures, whether living kinds or not, let alone human kinds. Warlocks are experts for manipulations upon intuitions. Edwin was resisting this intuition by his best. </p>
<p>He recalled many years ago, when they engaged with a army of human kinds. Right before the fight, the monk told him about the sorrowful stories: The monk was 7 years younger than he. His family was destroyed. His ex-wife sued him. He was tortured in a cage, where every decent man -including his own family leftovers- participated in the cruel ritual. They burnt every inch of the festered skins on the monk - if they were still skins. They smashed bones of the monk. They shot stimulants, keeping the monk alive and sensitive for the endless torments. But the monk tried his best in meditation, numb. </p>
<p>So during that fight, the mage was in great danger when he was rooted in a snare as magic missiles channeled at him. He couldn’t dash with his magic force, let alone physical movements. He thought he was dying in seconds. But not until being bombed like a beehive, the monk fly kicked in. His kick seemed to slow and freeze the missiles a bit. Then, strangely, he drifted around the mage, blocking and catching all the missiles with his flesh, his back. The skins burnt in lights at once, but the explosions soon enervated, frozen and cool. Aye, the monk caught all the missiles with his flesh and bones… shielded with his skins, but with nothing else.</p>
<p>“You really are a monk… “ Edwin said, “more than that, you are a monk-ster. “</p>
<p>The monk was a watchman still, reading around any potential risk and hazard, so silent, without his usual joking back. </p>
<p>“Do you hear me? Man. But you were really slow. Why you didn’t just kick that guy on his head knocking him out cold! Man. “ </p>
<p>“I can’t deal that kind of burst damage. “ Rudi said. </p>
<p>“Now we are still trapped here. We must die and loose. I hate loosing, but I can’t figure out a way. I am fire mage, and they can resist most of my arts, let alone their damages are so fearful. I would just be bombed like a beehive, laying down like a waste. And after I die, they can just gather their armies against you. You will die soon. “</p>
<p>“You might be right. But don’t think like that. We can prevail. We can win. “</p>
<p>“Then show me how. This is so frustrated. They have all kinds of professions. I can’t do anything. “</p>
<p>“Remember, you are a mage in plates. And you structure, evoke fires with your wrath and emotions. They can’t stop you. “</p>
<p>“But this is not my fighting style at this moment. I want to win elegantly. “</p>
<p>“I knew. And in fact you already are. Just believe. Now, I will use my Chi Walls again, you cumulate your emotions upon the two opposite ends, until you can fully show them your wrath. “</p>
<p>“I can’t. This wastes my time! They can interfere our plan! “</p>
<p>“We are in charge, winning. Let alone no one can practically interfere your casting… your fires come from your emotions but not your concentrations, as you said. They have no chance against us. “</p>
<p>“Only if everything is right! Which is not! “</p>
<p>“Ok. Don’t worry. Now I am doing it. “ Rudi said coldly, starting the meditation sitting. </p>
<p>The wounds the blood started to solidify as the monk meditated. Then some leftovers of missiles flew out radiatively. During the time, green Chi gathered swirls, until they became ice cones-then ice walls. The two ends were identical. </p>
<p>Now the fire blazed in the mage’s eyes, as his fingers were heating. He raised his mace, roaring, there was a dragon’s head formed by flames, breathing, as many fireballs landed onto one end of the two ice walls. As a fireball hit one end, it bounced into the other end of the walls, reflecting continuously. There were too many, so as to turn out being a stream of lava between two ends. </p>
<p>“This is just a waste of time. And I am now angrier and angrier! “ Edwin complained, for he knew the enemies were too many, and they were no laypeople. They were professional soldiers and fighters. They knew how to manipulate and control, gearing good weapons, dealing good damages. They could counter our defence, as they also were clever, with strategies and tactics in minds. We should just try to negotiate our best bets in lieu of fighting for nothing, shit.  The more he thought, the angrier he was. He just wanted to burn, burning this shitty situation.</p>
<p>“Later they would slow me with their lights and curses, before the assassins would target on you. They want to cut loose your head, with their daggers in lightening speed, after the warriors would dash you to knock your head with their shield to disorienting you. Now my frozen Chi is protecting your neck. Don’t dodge. Again, don’t dodge! And don’t fire dash. Please. Just believe in your wraths. All you have to do is to melt the ground in flames with your cumulated wraths. Let them know who is their daddy. “</p>
<p>“Then I only have one shot. This doesn’t make sense. Anyone survives, I die. Then you will die, too. “</p>
<p>“Only if some members would try to kill me. Which they had tried and failed. They won’t try again, for they know they cannot cut thru my skins, let alone my bones. “</p>
<p>“And the gunners and mages will still be alive, shooting us. Then I will die. “</p>
<p>“I will absorb any damage. It’s painful, but after all, no significant damages for me. And I am fast, sure your safety. “ </p>
<p>“In theory. Only in your theory. What if we fail, we all die. “</p>
<p>“No worry. Now. “ Rudi yelled with his deep cold voice, praying it works. Even he never knew. Focus on positive things is the only thing he can do, for his life was a great sorrow. That’s how he survives. </p>
<p>Then Rudi faked as if he is paralysing the shooters. The enemies are experts of combats, so they knew Rudi has no damage. They thought the monk and wizard were just impatient and agitated. They thought their chances came. </p>
<p>Then the fighters dash onto the fire wizard Edwin, along with the shadow dances of assassins unto his back. Cut off the head, kill it, and win. </p>
<p>The other members slowed Rudi with greasing snares, so that the main damage dealers can kill Edwin with their bursts. </p>
<p>Then Edwin roared, “You fool mortals. “ bending over, hitting the ground with his mace of arcanite. “Burn! In my wrath and anger. “</p>
<p>The assassins showed up, spinning their body each, except one squatting in the front lower body of Edwin, as two fighters dashed on left, right side of Edwin. Edwin was focus, for he was angry. </p>
<p>When the daggers swung near the neck of the wizard, they were slowed by the frost Chi, along with the spiralling assassins’ hands gripping them. No assaults were successful just yet, at least during this wave of hits. </p>
<p>The man squatted in front of the wizard thought he got the good timing for a deadly strike, but he was wrong, as he reverse slashed with his long dagger from the bottom, or short sword, he just felt pain on his right hand…, which blew away. Burnt, exploded, withered, charred. “Ahh…” he screamed.</p>
<p>“My crotch is dangerous. Fool. “ he thought, but never said, for he was focusing on his deadly thermodynamics spells. </p>
<p>In this world, there are three laws in the thermodynamics: First law is the law of conservation, energy in each system is isolated, which means energy’s amounts are constant during a process. And the Second law is the law of irreversibility of natural process, which, once any process done, means entropy should only increase. And the Third law, suggesting the release of cumulated energy unto a state called residual entropy, is the backbone of all process. Edwin’s magic depends solely on the law of thermodynamics. So some of his abilities accumulating his wraths, which is not revertible process, and releasing wraths brings him back to his inner state into residual entropy times an unknown value, as such motions of his releasing wraths is the major source of damages he dealt. That’s why the tactics of monk and wizard could work, for the wraths generated are not reversible, until the wizard releases all of them, incinerating all the place into hell of flames. Let alone the two ends of walls accumulated the wraths and leftover heatings in much acceleration.</p>
<p>“Reduce.. To Aaaaaash. “ as he said, all the airs became a combustion of superheat. The water gasses were too high in temperature, as if there were fogs of flames, burning every each of anything. He visualised his anger into reality, if it’s not reality more than true, and cruel. Now even metals of weapon and gears were burning, as they were melting - all at once, actually, everything was incinerated, reducing to the ashes. </p>
<p>It was a total silence. Heating, no bodies, but all white colour powders. You don’t want to know what the powders were. Cremated, nothing left. </p>
<p>Fast, no concentration required. He casted this total destruction out under gang bangs. They could not interfere him by any chance. This is the rage wizard Edwin. </p>
<p>But now he still in his hesitation was sneaking, though he knew he should overcome the fears in heart. </p>
<p>“Maybe I just focus on cumulating wraths, so I don’t fear. “ good idea, he raised his ring hand, shooting fireballs in random directions. No hitting, no wraths, but at least preventing feeling of fears. </p>
<p>He sought to pull something with his Force. But in vein did he pull anything. This place is like a void. How did Rudi get in so fast? Or just it had different spaces? He didn’t know. He didn’t want to dwell in the feeling about it, for this just burdened him. He knew he need to deviate his unpleasant feelings. </p>
<p>So he kept pulling things, or at least air, and fingering fireballs on no targets. The space was so dark, that even fireballs couldn’t light the environment. But he finally found a way of marching: by random fireballs and force pulling he might sense direction, despite so eyesights. </p>
<p>He kept marching on his steps. Interestingly, he got the feelings of wraths energy. Aye, he hit something, or somebody, despite in total darkness. </p>
<p>Finally he saw a slight light upon his head. He knew this is the way. He used his force to pull himself onto the wall, or anything, crawling in the dark, drifting upward. </p>
<p>Now a burning shadow ghost showed up suddenly, behind his back. He knew that, fingering it, a flame fist in his image came out, devouring the already burning shadow ghost, before he kept drifting up with his Force. He looked more like a furious warrior with superpower than anything. </p>
<p>Then he finally saw the frost-injured senior warlock, and the monk in meditation. Sitting? He thought, but suddenly he knew the monk was doing the mind game against the warlock, for the warlocks are experts of minds, as, in fact, warlocks are too dependent to mind tricks, so sometimes significant defects are along with their practice of minds. Their advantage could be their greatest enemy. That’s also why the monk always said, my peace of mind is my strongest hold. </p>
<p>Then he raised his mace, ejecting a column of flames extending onto the warlock from his mace, burning the airs. As the monk, later, turned the frost Chi around the frost injuries in warlock’s body, into frozen alcohol, the body of warlock became a cage of extremely high pressure and heat. <em>Boom!</em> The body of the warlock bursted just like a blasted bloom. Blood and meats spread everywhere, before they burnt to coal, darkened. The black body parts and burnt-out blood were just another piece of Edwin’s artworks. </p>
<p>“So what postponed you so long? Man. “ Edwin said as if nothing ever happened. </p>
<p>“Hah ha, aye, I be damage dealer not like thou. You killed him in less than one second. “</p>
<p>“I don’t care. We should have more time talking and drinking. They are just trash. “</p>
<p>“Ah, haha, okay. Well, this is the evidence. “</p>
<p>“Who cares the evidence?!”</p>
