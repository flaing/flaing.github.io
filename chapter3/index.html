        <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="Chapter-III-The-reunion"><a href="#Chapter-III-The-reunion" class="headerlink" title="Chapter III: The reunion"></a>Chapter III: The reunion</h1><p>The monk is on a horseback, raiding. Much warmer, and the sky is blue, but not purple as usual. </p>
<p>Tis different nation. But he remained his confidence in eyes, suggesting his former presence here. </p>
<p>The sun shined the robe. But unlike conventional robe -silky and light-colour- dark dirts upon it are the only thing drizzling. But this monk can’t care less.</p>
<p>“Ah, my nippy sweetie, here”</p>
<p>He stopped by in front of a large tree, confident and familiar. He gently swept the soil. Interestingly, the soil flipped and waved, until a cask showed. </p>
<p>He took out the cask from the soil, sniffing a bit around the rotating cask. </p>
<p>“Good enough” if not mumbling. </p>
<p>This cask looks heavy -and it’s large- not until the monk toyed it like this. </p>
<p>Then he roped the cask on his back, back to the journey. </p>
<p>He is used to dryness and coldness on the North. But it seems to him that he addapt this rather warmer and wetter airs much quicker. During the night -the time belongs to starts and moon- he let moon and stars shine upon his beaming while he sitting, calm and cold. You don’t know whether he slept or not. </p>
<hr>
<p>“Behold, your thing is too big to be allowed in the town.”</p>
<p>The other day, the guard for the gate stopped the monk.</p>
<p>“Greeting sir. But tis important. “</p>
<p>“Important for what? “</p>
<p>“Important for me to get in with my carry-on. “</p>
<p>“No. Layman. You can’t. You don’t listen. Take it off. Now. “</p>
<p>“Sorry sir. “ Then he leid down the cask.</p>
<p>“Take it in. You four. “</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>4 heaviest soldiers went to rope it, after that, they sought to lift it, until they couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Too heavy. Sir. “</p>
<p>“Then break it. “</p>
<p>“No, please. “ Rudi begged them, but they ignored. They prepared biggest hammers. 1-2-3, they drummed it, and again, and again, until the hammers split. </p>
<p>That’s strange, not only the robustness of the cask, but also the splits of the hammers- they seemed frozen.</p>
<p>“How dare you? Another unlicensed mage? Tie him. “</p>
<p>“Yes sir. “ Spellbreakers came out from the shadow - they are one of the fearful enemy for mage in this world. They can intervene and <em>devour</em> spells, metally torturing any caster in front of them, when magic chains in their hands.</p>
<p>“No please sir… “</p>
<p>“And you four, prepare enhanced siege tool to smash this crap. “</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>Just as spellbreakers got near, with magic chains in hands, Rudi palmed right cheek of each spellbreaker in lightening speed. </p>
<p>“What? oh..”</p>
<p>Interestingly, they seemed paralysed, if not frozen.</p>
<p>“Shame on you. Killer! Try to kill all of us during the war time. How pethetic! “ The commander yelp.</p>
<p>“Ye art not dead, gentlemen. Let alone the fact that you attacked first. I will no trouble. “</p>
<p>“We are the justice. And you don’t abide by the law here. You don’t belong here. “</p>
<p>“Indeed you can define your justice. I am sorry again. But as I said, I will no trouble. “ Rudi replied.</p>
<p>“Sir we can’t break the cask with even +6 smashing machine. “</p>
<p>“This must be a conspiracy. You hide something from us. Mage. “</p>
<p>“Whatever you say sir. I want my time, and you play your bet. “</p>
<p>“Watch your words. Gambling is not allowed here.”</p>
<p>“Aye, not allowed here, for laymen like us, but not for you sirs. Every single day, you sirs gamble everything, such as my cask, for no reason. “</p>
<p>“I am the law. How dare you? Civilian. “</p>
<p>“Definitely. And I dare not, don’t get me wrong. I will no troubles. “ </p>
<p>“Your words don’t align with your actions. You hurt my people, and agitated me. “ </p>
<p>“I follow your judgement. But again, I want to have my time, and you have your bets and gambling. Peace. “</p>
<p>“My judgement is you should be put to death. “</p>
<p>“Everyday for me is dead. I am already dead, before frost soothed me. “</p>
<p>“You are too prideful. You dare to speak the nonsense before God. You have no God in your deceitful heart. “</p>
<p>“God said He will punish bad officials and princes, but not put His wrath upon us helpless civilians. “</p>
<p>“And you also slandered me, the law, saying us gamblers. “</p>
<p>“For I can read your mind. “</p>
<p>“Prideful pig. “</p>
<p>“Thank you. And I am leaving, with my keg indeed. “</p>
<p>“This guy calls this huge cask a keg. What’s wrong with his mind? “ a paralysed spellbreaker thought. </p>
<p>“Now, snipers. “</p>
<p>Just as the monk bowed, paused to move his foot, three bullets flied and stroke from his right side, unto his head.</p>
<p>The bullets were made of enhanced dark iron. This material is pretty dense, so as to accelerate the speed. </p>
<p>The monk doesn’t have time to dodge, let alone during bowing. Dark iron can transform into any most deadly weapons on the earth, let alone enhanced by magic. </p>
<p>However, no oozing, nor bleeding, as they indeed hit the target. The monk’s skin seemed to catch the three bullets, if not freeze them. </p>
<p>“Don’t stir the water. Just calm down. “ Rudi said, as his left hand grab all the bullets from his head. </p>
<p>And he tread, if not tremble the ground, before he breathes a deep green fog, around the air. The texture of the mist was not usual water, but something similar to alcohol, if not stronger than alcohol. And it smelled good, but freezing cold. </p>
<p>“Stupid.. bare-head.. willy.. “ the commander put. The soldiers, along with the commander, started disoriented, slowed down, and cool. </p>
<p>“Drink before you drive. Drive crazy not. Just calm and maintain. Gentleman. “ Rudi murmured to himself, for he knew nobody listening. </p>
<p>Then he rode on, with his huge “keg” carried on the back, as if nothing happened. Wind blew, freezing-cold.  </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Then he stopped by a lake, as if seeing something. </p>
<p>Warmer, heated, as the airs put. A large fireball rushed -he dodged not- onto the ground near him. He knew that. </p>
<p>“Well. It has been a long time. “</p>
<p>“Hey trashy monk. Why didn’t you die? “</p>
<p>“Ah I got our nice whisky. I distilled it with a keg made of iced pelatumba wood and soft mass-dense ironised coal, put it under the grillian tree. And you don’t want to know where the malt from. No kidding. “</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t want to know every your engineering shit. “</p>
<p>“Anyhow, prepare to enjoy your life now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my life is like shit. “ Edwin replied shortly, with his higher, energetic pitch. </p>
<p>“Don’t say that. Be positive. “ calmly, as Rudi opened the keg, collecting some golden fluid. </p>
<p>“You knew. Buddy. We are trash. “</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. We are good, at least right at this moment. “</p>
<p>“Fuck this world. I just feel…” Edwin said, as as the nip of Edwin’s share was warmed all at once. “ANGRY…”</p>
<p>“Aye, everyday can be frustrated. “ Rudi replied.</p>
<p>“It turns out that girl only wastes my time. Although she is cute, I don’t want to fuck her anymore. “ Edwin quaffed. “Oh fuck you stupid kid. This is too spicy too strong. “</p>
<p>“Sip, thou shalt, instead. Ha ha look at you. “ Rudi beamed, after he quaffed. </p>
<p>“You have no taste. Man. Why don’t you make wine or beer? “ Edwin said. </p>
<p>“Did you hear I brew wine or beer? Not to my ability. “ </p>
<p>“Anyway, that girl.. she is my type. Small in height, around 152 cm, big boobs, around 34F, and very hot and alluring in her traits, man, as she touched me, I got hard on! You knew my power and strength. Oh, I didn’t eject last night. What a shame. I feel really angry. “ </p>
<p>“Aye sometimes you just can’t. “</p>
<p>“I wanted to cum, but something wasn’t right last night. Her attitude. At the final posture -I went from her behind- I could tell she didn’t concentrate on our matter. What the hell. “</p>
<p>“Aye, bloody hell. “</p>
<p>“Yeah! She didn’t respect me, nor respect our love making. That’s.. frustrated. Women always disappoint me. What have I done, as every end of my relationship comes to this? “</p>
<p>“Do you love her? “ </p>
<p>“I like her body. Small body and big boobs, you knew. She is like a toy of my penis. I can control her solely by my penis and my magic. Inside her, my penis is so warm, greasy. She is wet too. All the time, even until she showed her reluctance, her pussy was wet as hell. And she is really cute, passionate. I also enjoyed her moaning. “</p>
<p>“Copulatory vocalisations. “</p>
<p>“Yeah, her moaning was like singing, rhymed by the root of my penis. My penis is the baton of the music, the authority of her small and fit body, and her vagina is my territory. “</p>
<p>“Ok. “</p>
<p>“But I didn’t cum. And I am not happy now. “</p>
<p>“Sip and forget. “</p>
<p>“Fuck that. Fuck that girl. And I don’t want to fuck her again. “</p>
<p>“Calm and forget. “ Rudi said onto the mage of rage. </p>
<p>Then the mage sipped, and made a deep breath, the plates on his chest moving, rhymed with his breath. </p>
<p>His plates look pretty robust, but not that heavy, at least to his movement eligible to the should-be-heavy plates. </p>
<p>“You see my ring and mace are still bright. So do my plates. I clean them everyday. I like heavy metals. “ </p>
<p>“By water? “</p>
<p>“No, by my cleanse spells. “</p>
<p>“Oh, you meant your flames. “</p>
<p>“Yeah. The surface and the solid should be treated in different processes. I got a lot of magic to do for their beauty. You knew, I concern the beauty the most. “</p>
<p>“Aye, you are the artist. “</p>
<p>“People thought I am a paladin by my plates when I am the better wizard. And in fact not only wizard I am but also an artist. “</p>
<p>“Whole world is my canvas, as you said. “</p>
<p>“That’s right! That’s who I am. That’s what I do! Oh man. But this world is a crap, especially after they came. “</p>
<p>“Ok. Sip. “</p>
<p>“Yeah. I like your beverage, soothing my heart always. But why you always brewed drink of such strong alcohol. This would just shade its beauty and flavour. You know nothing about arts. “</p>
<p>“Well. To my limit. “ The monk quaffed again, adding “I want to call this one The Frozen Heart. How do you like the name? “</p>
<p>“Whatever. But I don’t appreciate your old-school style of naming anyway. “</p>
<p>“Hah. High way to hell. “ Rudi replied with a smile. </p>
<p>“Hell of shit. “</p>
<p>“Bloody hell. “ coldly he mumbled. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>This was the other day of fogs. Cloudy a bit, but no rains in prospect. </p>
<p>“Dominating” Rudi said, as they watched the fighters among gladiators in an arena. They were slaves fighting for their freedom. Usually, it’s quite brutal. This nation has layers of layers for gladiators -or champions, whatever they say- and this game is not in the major leagues. </p>
<p>“You knew. If I were he, I fuck them with fire balls. Or just scorch them with my gazes and breath. “</p>
<p>“Aye I knew you would. “</p>
<p>“You can also put them in your storm of fists and legs. Man, you are the juicer. “</p>
<p>“I don’t know. “</p>
<p>“You already knew. You are the juicer, freezing them below zero, and blasting them into snowflakes. “ </p>
<p>“Ah. Ha ha. After all, we are the symphony of snows and flames. “ Rudi added, delightfully.</p>
<p>In this world, the reproduction of human kinds is pretty short, about only 6 months. So there are big populations among all the nations in this world, despite endless warfares recently, and constant combats as entertainment. Some competitions, especially in major leagues, have good magical protections upon the champions for their safety, for after all, they are freemen who fight for their ethnicity, group, company, guild, or even just for profits. But those slaves today don’t have that luck, though some of them have the potentials for advance in higher level, if they can walk out of the arena with full limbs. Yes, if one lost limbs, likely he’d not come back to the arena, let alone contracts between any team. </p>
<p>“So until now, for hours, where are they?! ”</p>
<p>“I thought they will come. ”</p>
<p>“Which they didn’t. You are wrong. ”</p>
<p>“We can enjoy the game, after all. ”</p>
<p>“Frustrated! I want some wine under Turtutoriotrits on the south after today’s boringness. ”</p>
<p>“Oh, I miss that place too. ”</p>
<p>“Yeah, one of best bars on the earth. Owned by some cool Tortollan guys. Their jokes and music are better than other bards and bartenders. ”</p>
<p>“Aye they really got that talent. Brev, I really want to be a tortollan. With that shell, I can do anything, at least I can join their cute league. ”</p>
<p>“No you can’t. Stupid. You are just a piece of monk, knowing nothing about arts. ”</p>
<p>“Aye, a piece of monk. ”</p>
<p>“We have pathetic lives, sitting here waiting for nothing. Even if we succeed catching the demons, no one would thank us, for they all have demonic hearts. They just say, OH YOU TWO ARE FREAKS. This is the truth of this fallen evil world. ”</p>
<p>“Aye, I remember last time, they said what the hell are ya? A monk in grubby gears, and a mage in stupid plates? And they kept saying that. Mayhaps this is their way of thanksgiving. ”</p>
<p>“And my weapons are mace and ring. I don’t give a shit of their comments. I am who I am. ” Edwin replied. </p>
<p>“Aye, you are the iron man, if not harder than iron. ”</p>
<p>“I am even harder when I am hard on. Indeed, I need a cute girl for the hard ignition. ”</p>
<p>“Before she ignites your sorrows after your sex. ”</p>
<p>“Oh man. You are totally right. ”</p>
<p>“Brilliant. ” </p>
<p>“And I hate that. ”</p>
<p>“Look. ”</p>
<p>Then one gladiator was mutilated by a deadly slash, as his arm flew thru the air, spreading blood everywhere, as the arteries were cut loose neatly. His opponent looked like a pretty good daggers swinger, while he is not stabbing type, but a slashing type, who uses tricky angle of dual daggers to cut flesh and bones neatly like scissors on the principle of leverage. This type of swordsman have agility and strength. </p>
<p>“As blood came out, temptation will arrive. “ Rudi commented, just as the crowd yelled and hailed ironically joyous, if not cruel. </p>
<p>“The people get me sick. ” Edwin sighed. </p>
<p>“Any blood, from vanguard or from sole entertainment, contributes the Thirsty. ”</p>
<p>“They can’t care less. “</p>
<p>The crowd yelled even louder. Some started to yelp, “Kill him. Kill him. This maggot should be eviscerated. ” “Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! “ They are passionate, happy, but ironically hateful, as they breathed such words in joyous manners. They didn’t know why, but they are more than normal. Maybe some of them thought this is just for fun. Let alone judging people is always more than fun. </p>
<p>Who are the audiences? They are good-behavioured and educated civilians, most of them are scholars, bankers or top businessmen in this town -no everyone can afford the price of a game in arena, let alone donations usually mandatory- but when they were in situation like this, they always showed such kind of traits. Perhaps this is just a nature of human, blood thirsty, as people kept denying on their education systems. And now, some warlock agency takes advantage of this human nature for their profits. Again, warlocks are also decent professions in this age. Decent people always have decent way to collect the dirtiest money. </p>
<p>“But I am not swallowing it. I am angry. “ Edwin said. </p>
<p>“I knew. But we need evidence. That’s why we are here. ”</p>
<p>“Yeah I knew. I am the lawyer. But I want to burn them after I humiliate them in the court. ”</p>
<p>“Aye we can. ”</p>
<p>“Fuck them. ” Edwin said. </p>
<p>In the academia of the magic, there are 7 orthodox schools in classical, or old school, classification. They are, Adjuration for protecting, Conjuration for Summoning, Divination for detecting, Enchantment for controlling, Evocation for element arts, Illustration for imaging, Necromancy for life manipulations. That’s why we usually said a good mage is a “Master of Seven Arts”. In a more modern classification, some universities divide the knowledge body of magic into Fire, Ice, Arcane, Lightening, Chaos, in lieu of old-school 7 arts system, for combat pragmatism -or so-called specialisations system- such that trainee can focus on one. </p>
<p>“You knew. I am a genius of fire. I casted my first fireball when I was two years old. Usually, even academical genius learn to control the fire after their 18. ” Edwin shared.</p>
<p>“Aye you said that before. ”</p>
<p>“And you knew what? All the mage educations are pussy. I am the hard on, so I do no pussy, despite attending Omegamanism University, best magical university in the world we know. Finally I came out a way to cast magic from my fury and wrath -I call it my rage system- but not any more from concentration system that conventional people use. That was pathetic system. ”</p>
<p>“And you focus on fire. ”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Any other specialisation is just toy to me. “</p>
<p>“At least not to your talent, for you are the fire guy. And you wear plates. “</p>
<p>“That’s right. I am the fire guy. I can visualise my emotion, evoking them into actual fires and flames. And I wear plates. I am awesome. ”</p>
<p>“Aye, thou art. “</p>
<p>“They do evading, blinking, wanding that kind of crap. I got my fire dash. I use my Force and my Fire. F&amp;F. ”</p>
<p>“Aye you are one of the best wizards. And you marched your own path. You can’t care less about Master of Seven Arts. ”</p>
<p>“Because I am better than they. “</p>
<p>“You are the iron man who melts the enemy. “</p>
<p>“That’s right! That’s who I am! And it’s an irony that body of mage is fragile when mage still insists to wear clothes rather than plates. They train no their buts, having no brains. ”</p>
<p>“But I knew you can’t endure attacks, even if you wear plates. “</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, you are my cover. You read, shade and heal pains and attacks for me, as I cleanse the offenders. “</p>
<p>“They are nothing before you. You don’t need endurance. You just hurt them and destroy them. ”</p>
<p>“That’s right. That’s who I am. “ Edwin said proudly. </p>
<p>Now that the monk read a pretty offensive draining force in the airs, perhaps due to some warlock’s Business Curse, as it collected <em>Thirsty</em> energy. The conversion rate of energy storage wasn’t good enough at this time. But this field of study already attracted the eyes of many seed investors, for the early adapters also thought the Thirsty Energy Transformed Magical Storage is a big plus for their lives as well as their careers. If the business practitioners -the warlocks- can grow their business and sell it, it’s a good business model no matter what. They can’t care less about the conversion rate and the pragmatism, if their ideas are brilliant product market fit. </p>
<p>“They are doing it,” said the monk.</p>
<p>“And we are stopping them,” replied the mage. </p>
