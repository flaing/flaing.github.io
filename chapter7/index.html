She utilised this artefact to accelerate her chanting. Now it’s on the finger of Edwin, for Edwin’s casting requires on chanting, this is for him to outpour multiple flames at one time. </p>
<p>When Edwin was a lucky disciple of his pretty selective alma mater, Madam Sherlock considered him as one of the best student she ever had. Not so luckily, however, Edwin was a victim of bullies, for no reason, by some upright-considered regular and normal peers. Some “good student” just played around him. Sometime, even teachers joined this kind of harassments. But Madam Sherlock was different. She liked this kid. </p>
<p>When the bullies first started, he was always too afraid and angry to do anything proper. he wanted to fight back, even wanted to kill the bullies, especially when killing in all nations is legal in this world, but he was too vulnerable, too weak and too afraid of getting hurt. </p>
<p>But he still got hurt. A lot, both mentally and physically. He had severe injuries during his study, especially his right shoulder, due to the bullies. </p>
<p>While, Edwin is always a talented student, wasting no time. As he fired his first fireball, a very destructive wide-ranging spell in this world, when he was just 2 years old, his mastery exceeded a remarkable level when he was in college, growing. His misfortune, however, also contributed his mastery in another level, luckily. He focused on his own things, for he had no social activities. He pursued all kinds of arts in cooking, artworks, and, the most important, his personal style of casting. </p>
<p>He willed to waste no time, so he always sought a way to cast spells with no time. He was usually angry in his school life, especially during he was bullied. “Too angry to say a word” as he always thought and felt, he started to visualise his anger, and later, to visualise his casting process. He organised and planned various ways for making the process more vivid, and improved it, day by day. Finally, he found a way to utilise his anger to “chant” when he was “too angry to say a word”.</p>
<p>As he became stronger and stronger everyday, the bullies became less and less, perhaps due to the general maturity of the age of students, though he still hated the bullies and the ugly world, even until now. That’s why he wanted to burn so badly as to cleanse this dirty filthy world. Bad guys should be put to death, but this world doesn’t have death penalty, when killing alone is ironically legal, he is more than willing to get his hands dirty killing these evildoers. Burning, for revengeance. </p>
<p>Right before his graduation, his proud teacher Madam Sherlock granted him this ring - The Ring Of Scarlet, and fixed him up with his first girlfriend, or at least first sex partner, Elena. This is another story. </p>
<hr>
<p>Most so-called sorrowful people’s sorrows came from the witness of great sorrows, or just claiming so. But the monk’s sorrows were anecdotal, personal, and real in every inch of his skins. </p>
<p>Suffering and bleeding, endlessly, until he appreciated the beauty of death and hollow, with eyes more than pale. That was the only thing in his past. </p>
<p>After escape, and exile, from the endless torments, for years he has traveled and meditated in total coldness, as nothing seems never to take away. Aye, having nothing, yet things kept being took away. That’s the history of Rudi. His life, possessions, family, relationships were took away, if not everything.  </p>
<p>But there is no hatreds, strangely. For he lost his hope, time after time for everything, he only wants to forget, to freeze, and to forgive anyone, for anything. </p>
<p>So his palms became frost poisoned, and his forehead was frost infected. His every body part, once destroyed and tortured, reborn into frozen chilling energy absorbers, including every his flesh and bones. His mind can read the airs, and freeze and manipulate Chi. </p>
<p>He also drunk a lot, especially during the beginning of the breakout when he quaffed a 10-gallons barrel of whisky in only a day in order of his crippled arm and leg. Mayhaps he had choice, but rather to forget, freezing his body and pains with strong alcohols. Sometimes he can transform the fluids into alcohols if Chi linked. Until now, no one knew he does it how. </p>
<p>We could barely know all the background about him, until his exile time in the north lands. </p>
<p>In glacial cold winds, a mankind wore only a piece of cloth, or sheet, sit under a tree. With eyes closed, his look was calm. He should be painful, for his right arm seemed crippled and festered. The only anodyne could be the ceaseless gale of ice cold. “I am pretty lucky, at least my arm wasn’t cut loose, at least it’s right arm but not left arm. ” When he sit, his legs crossing, with right leg upper flipping upon the left one. </p>
<p>It has been more than 5 years, since his arm and leg was crippled, though his leg was healed. </p>
<p>“Now I should come back to the room. “ He lifted himself up a bit, before he stood up in the air, then, trampling. His eyes were still closed. Now, green colour airs around him gather into a sphere of Chi where he was inside. His body was fading, like snowflakes drifting, swirling inside the sphere, until his body disappeared. </p>
<p>Here was total darkness, as if there was a dark sun in the chamber. He was in the “room” of no lights. The atmosphere wasn’t fearful, but just peaceful. He found this place 5 years ago. He read this place everyday. This was his genesis of rebirth. He didn’t know who owns here. He didn’t know whether he has the permission. He never met anyone here. He didn’t even know what this place for. He didn’t know the time, let alone whether his usage was correct. He just came inside, and read it. He didn’t even know the actual geological location, which means, if he walks by foot, he hardly walks into this cave. </p>
<p>As if this place belongeth to him much earlier before he acknowledged this place, he read this place everyday. Mayhaps this place belongeth to him even before he was born? Born, tortured, if not killed once. Again, forget, freeze and forgive, under the realm of eternal ice. Aye, everyday is his warfare against temptations and frustrations. He only wanted to read this place, fortifying his mind. He only focuses on positive thoughts. He is the developer of inner true power. But he, again, even didn’t know what he had been doing. He just meditated and read, without knowing everything, day after day. </p>
