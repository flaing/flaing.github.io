<p>“Tell me, vitualising it. “</p>
<p>“I can put it unto your head, but I can’t vitualise it, for I am not a mage like you. “</p>
<p>“Come on. But I need see that with my eyes. My damage can only be done one hundred percents with good sights. “</p>
<p>“Maybe that direction. I am not sure. They are using demonic gateway for their virtual private networks, where I cannot penetrate into, let alone telling you properly and precisely. “ Rudi played his mustache and beard thin as he explained. </p>
<p>“Then if you do it, I cannot fully cover you with my fire. You will be damaged hugely before I can see and fire. “</p>
<p>“I born to endure damage. No worry. “</p>
<p>“Man. You are <em>Bald</em>. “</p>
<p>“Aye my bald head is the answer. “</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s do it. “</p>
<p>Then the monk started to reveal their intents with his <em>Eye of Mind</em>. He freezed some Thirsty Enegy in the air, along with the <em>tracer ruins</em> ejected by his Chi. He ejected his Chi to show the presence of both ends, such that he let Edwin the lawyer prove about Warlocks collecting energy from human sins upon a bloody events.</p>
<p>But in this nation, everyone has the right to kill if they get the balls and power. This in the law is the Principle of Self Protection. So the warlocks arm themselves with destruction spells. If they can kill the invaders and cage all the evidence seekers, they can provide their innocence, no matter what people think of them. </p>
<p>Let alone their good reputation and decent privilege. In fact, it’s hard to be a mage or a warlock, as so many laymen send their children studying magic. But usually warlocks are higher caste by family background, compare to what middleclass as to mage -indeed, only if they succeed- only 0.1% of all the trainees finally make it as a mage or a warlock. Again, this is a very challenging study and career. It needs a lot of efforts and training. After study, many nations require magic practitioners -so-called mage or warlocks- to have at least 3 years clinical training by a certified institute before they can sit in the bar for Licensed Magic Practitioner Test. </p>
<p>Now, the monk was <em>hacking</em> the access point of energy transportation with his freezing kick. He already collected many tracer ruins -his data and records for evidence of Edwin’s case- in this access point. Now he only need to take it with them. </p>
<p>“Bald falk. Don’t you know how many traps are here? I knew so many people want our business secrets. But no one like you just walks in. “</p>
<p>“I can’t hide before the eyes you put, so I hide not. “ The monk replied. </p>
<p>“Good point. But still, you need lay down. “</p>
<p>The warlock started to cast magic before the monk, as monk was stunned by a demonological trap. At least, he should, in fact, he wasn’t at all stunned, to the warlock’s surprise. </p>
<p>The whole atmosphere was darken, broken for eyesights, as if they were in another matrics of dimensions set. So Edwin can do nothing. This is a Time Wraaper Zone. </p>
<p>“Arise!”</p>
<p>Just as a bolt came from the warlock, spiraling and sinking, a pair of demonic claws <em>flowered</em> from underneath of the monk. </p>
<p>“I can’t stun you with my trap, but you will be slowed by my other spells, eating my bolt thereby. This is an art. You have no where to wrong. “ the warlock thought.</p>
<p>As he predicted, the bolt hit the target, causing a shadow swirl around the body of the monk. He was burn with dark fire, infected by the darkness, oozing dark blood. </p>
<p>But the swirl and the wound started to “slow down”, as if they were frozen. </p>
<p>“Frozen flesh can grant me peace. “ He couldn’t mitigate the pains, but could just take it as nothing. </p>
<p>Then the damage was staggered and frozen. </p>
<p>“You are a monstre, aren’t you? “ The warlock started to scortch him with dark fire. </p>
<p>“No. But just a monk, or a hermit. “ The monk again took the pains, swallowing them with his frozen flesh, staggering, as he finally walked near the warlock, and stroke with his powerful left fist. </p>
<p>He was expecting a knockout as he hit, but nothing happened. </p>
<p>The warlock blinked into another position, <em>kiting</em> this monk. Dark infections and dark burnings were still active onto the monk, despite frozen and staggered.</p>
<p>He could endure the pains, but it doesn’t mean the pains were tolerable and bearable! It’s about one million times the feeling of a woman giving birth. Tis why victims of such spells usually get stunned and feared. </p>
<p>He maintained his best to calm his painful mind, thinking about rivers and mountains. He knew, he had to hit at least three times in a raw -hard enough indeed- to actually hurt and stop the warlock.</p>
<p>This warlock enhanced and continuously manipulated the infections and scortch on the monk. If it’s conventional fighter or something -even the bravest- they can just run away or beg before the warlock for stopping. But he just calmly walked like a wind, near and near to the warlock. </p>
<p>“I am the supply chain manager. Don’t mess with me. “ The warlock said unto the painful monk. </p>
<p>“And your systems have many vulnerabilities. “ He threw the combination, finally. An uppercut hit the liver of the warlock. “And I study them. “ The monk added. </p>
<p>The warlock blinked again, back to the original position. But he feels his body and mind slowed down, if not frozen, as if he was <em>poisoned by the coldness</em>. </p>
<p>“You don’t… know my… power. I can… immolate… you. “</p>
<p>“And I can investigate you. My friend would sue you. “ Coldly the monk replied.</p>
<p>The warlock sneered, and blinked into other position again, starting casting another unknown spell. Rudi thought, what is so-called immolate? Will this warlock sacrifice himself for a self-desctruction explosion? Not likely, for mages and warlocks fear death and pains the most. </p>
<p>So he started to read the warlock’s mind, but in vein as he efforted, for warlock can hide their minds if they pay attentions. No clues. Anyhow, he got near the warlock again -finally- freezing the spell with his silky cold breeze onto the emerging magical energy, from his right hook unto the face of warlock. He halted the casting, if not worse than that, as the warlock cannot even breathe at this moment, for he felt the air was too cold…</p>
<p>Then his body softened, his mind knew the warlock’s in danger. Left kick onto his face -not yet, for the devil guard was summoned by the amulet on his neck, blocking the kick. </p>
<p>The demon is very huge, about three times the height of Rudi, a monk of 178cm. The demon -she- blocked with her right wing, as she coiled into a shell like. </p>
<p>“How dare you. “ The warlock said. </p>
<p>“I knew you were too tired to blink again at that moment. “</p>
<p>“You don’t belong here. I could kill you. “</p>
<p>“You already tried with no mercy. I knew you couldn’t. “</p>
<p>“And you cannot hurt me. Monk. Your attacks are just too … puny, pethatic. “ Warlock mocked.</p>
<p>“Constant drippings wear away a stone. And your gateway is our testimony. “</p>
<p>“Over my dead body. “ Then the warlock started to cast again, as bright green covering orange colour sparked on his fanning palms. </p>
<p>The monk knew he must be quick. But he can only run and walk in front of this experienced warlock -windwalk kind of kungfu was already the fastest way to his limit, for he is not conventional rolling, flying, jumping and dancing kind of aggresive martial artists. He is the shield with no defect, but also the shield with no harm and slash. His head is more rock-solid than the heaviest-forged shield of a vindicated warrior or a paladin. That’s why -to him- he wears no arms, but just a shabby light cloth robe, without any single enhancement. </p>
<p>He knew he can’t just take the access point and run away, for warlock can mar him in any kind, even if he cannot kill him.</p>
<p>He wasn’t frustrated -by the mobility of the warlock- but indeed puzzled a lot. And he can hardly deal any significance. </p>
<p>“You are… a worthy opponent. “ The warlock put. </p>
<p>The combat continued another couple of minutes. There was, until then, no sign of ending. </p>
