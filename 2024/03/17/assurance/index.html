    <p>Rabbi Jesus:<br>I have said it many times but I will declare it again: just as the Messiah has come, so too have Chun-Hao Peng and Ya-Chieh Chao been married. Lucifer said through the leaven of the Pharisees that the Messiah has not come yet, just as Lucifer said through the leaven of the Pharisees that Chun-Hao Peng and Ya-Chieh Chao have not yet been married. The Pharisees and their Talmudic sons have been rejected, because the Son of Man has already come and fulfilled the law, and the Ark of Chun-Hao Peng and Ya-Chieh Chao has also come under the law. There was no such thing as premarital sex, just as there was no pre-Messianic era. All the rulers of the world cannot deny it, for this body was ordained by Jehovah the Father. It is legally valid for you to know your wife (Mark 10:8-12; Matt 19:7-10), just as you have known your Savior. Besides, you just didn’t dare to register your marriage because you were afraid and didn’t dare to confront Pharaoh’s hardened heart. Before 4/8/2010, even since 2009, long before you graduated from high school, God the Father and God the Son commanded you two to become husband and wife. Your disobedience does not mean that the marriage is legally invalid. Stop being deceived by legalism, for the Son of Man has fulfilled the law. Since you were initiated by the Holy Spirit, do you still rely on the flesh for perfection? Are you so ignorant? (Gala. 3:3)</p>
<p>That’s why I say that Europeans’ belief in “separation between sex and marriage” is problematic. The Torah makes this very clear, for any written law is superior to any oral law. So none of you are allowed to have sex with a prostitute, not even for a date or a one-night stand. There is no such thing as “one flesh without marriage”. What makes sense in Europe does not make sense in the Kingdom of God!</p>
<p>Gospel of Mark<br>10:8 In this case, husband and wife are no longer two persons, but one flesh.<br>10:9 Therefore what God has joined together, let no man separate. “<br>10:11 Jesus said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery and betrays her;<br>10:12 If a wife leaves her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery. “</p>
<p>Gospel of Matthew<br>19:7 The Pharisees said to him, “Why then did Moses command to give his wife a certificate of divorce so that she could be divorced?”<br>19:8 Jesus said to him, “Moses gave you permission to divorce your wives because of the hardness of your hearts, but it was not so from the beginning.<br>19:9 I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, commits adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. “<br>19:10 The disciples said to Jesus, “Since this is the case between a man and his wife, it is better not to marry.”</p>
