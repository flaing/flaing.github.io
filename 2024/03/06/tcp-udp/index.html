    <p>Most people totally misunderstood <em>John 14:6</em>. In fact, God the Son is like TCP, God the Father is like UDP, and the TCP connection is the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><em>Connection type</em><br>If you want to have communion with the Son, it must be through the Holy Spirit just like a TCP connection, and His will intends to be understandable for you.<br>The Holy Father can communicate with you through all things in heaven and earth, but you may not understand His will.</p>
<p><em>Data sequence</em><br>When you communicate with the Son, you can use sequences of time and language that humans can understand.<br>There will only be biblical symbols and sacred sequences in your communion with the Father. If you are stubborn on your own timeline and language, you will not be able to interpret the sequences of His will.</p>
<p><em>Data retransmission</em><br>You can make mistakes and be disobedient in your relationship with the Son. He will tell you again and again until you grieve the Holy Spirit of God.<br>If you make mistakes and disobey in your relationship with the Father, you will receive immediate consequences. You only have to drop the ball once and you will be considered an adulterer by the Holy Father for it.</p>
<p><em>Delivery</em><br>When you are in communion with the Son, your prayers will be heard and accepted by God. The revelations given to you by the Holy Son are also more acceptable to you.<br>When you have fellowship with the Holy Father, your prayers will be heard by God, but they may not necessarily be accepted. The revelations given by the Holy Father may be acceptable to you, or they may be unacceptable to you, such as telling you to kill your firstborn son, break up with your beloved, move to a distant and foreign place, etc.</p>
<p><em>Check for errors</em><br>When you commune with the Son, the Holy Spirit will make sure that you understand the Son and the Son understands you.<br>When you are in communion with the Holy Father, you may not be able to understand the Holy Father at all, or you may even be spiritually blind and deaf and unable to hear the Holy Father at all.</p>
<p><em>Broadcasting</em><br>The Son will not establish prophets, but he will establish preachers and all ministries.<br>The Father will anoint prophets, so-called “ambassadors from heaven” or “archangels.”</p>
<p><em>Speed</em><br>The voice of the Son through the Holy Spirit is a slow and thin whisper. It may not give you a huge and terrible message, but it will ensure that you can completely receive the message He gives you.<br>The voice of the Holy Father is the voice of many waters. The listener must have strong concentration and understanding to ensure that the message can be completely received.</p>
<p>Because all the factors of God the Father, Jesus said, <em>No one comes to the Father except through me</em>. Today, false teachings are still everywhere (in the USA), creating divisions among Jews and Christians through meaningless theology debates and secondary issues. This is the truth of the Antichrist spirit.<br>John 14:6<br>1 John 4:3<br>Galatians 4:6<br>0306<br>.</p>
