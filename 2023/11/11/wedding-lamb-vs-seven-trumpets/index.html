    <!-- Content -->
    <p>A lot of Christians and unbelievers complain God never came back and misquote how we don’t know the secret timing of rapture. But the more important question is, do we ever prepare ourselves for the wedding of the Lamb (Rev 19:7)? If we don’t pursue God back as we should, of course He’s not gonna come back to the wedding of the Lamb. He will just let us kill each other as the Beast and the Harlot over and over as we glorify our consumerist lifestyle as a “blessing” from God (Rev 17:16). </p>
<p>In today’s era of economic globalization, we have become not only “the waters where the Harlot sit” (Rev 17:15), but also “many peoples, races, nations, and languages” (Rev 17:15) who rebel against God. Many believers never set apart from unbelievers but have lived in the “ Babylon the great” and agreed with the consumerist lifestyle of the “the Harlot” (Rev 17:1). The Lord taught us to pray: “Give us this day our daily bread” (Matthew 6:11). But which of the houses, cars, lifestyle, attitude, and other Spiritual Obesity we pursue can be considered “daily bread” when we in the lukewarm waters call ourselves a Christian? The apostle Paul said: “As long as we have food and clothing, let us be content” (1 Tim. 6:8). But a good school, a good job, a good lifestyle, or a good mood that can satisfy us, which of them counts as “food and clothing”? Today ever since World War I, endless one economic crisis after another from generation to generation reminds us that “Babylon the great” is terminally ill and its Wicked End is certain, “for the Lord God who judges her is mighty” (Rev 18:8). “As the Harlot” used to “the glory and luxury she gave herself” (Rev 18:7), God will “let her suffer and mourn in the same way” (Rev 18:7); the less simple a believer’s life is on earth, the more miserable he or she will suffer in hell. So, why are we  “double-minded” (Hosea 10:2; James 1:8)? If we don’t repent ourselves from our wicked ways instead of feeling good about ourselves, how can we expect God to come back to the wedding of Lamb (Rev 19:7), and heal our lands (2 Chr 7:14)? I need more warriors on horses to fight alongside me, not lukewarm peacemakers where the Harlot sits. </p>
<p>No wonder the US government could shut down the churches, but could not shut down the liquor stores in our lukewarm waters (Rev 3:15-16). Why Biblical Government is small government? The responsibility given to the government by the Bible is not to take care of everything like US government, but to “executed justice and righteousness unto all his people” (1 Chronicles 18:14; 2 Chronicles 9:8), so that the people “can live a peaceful and godly life” (1 Timothy 2:2). Therefore, kings, priests, prophets, and judges were simply “a small government” endowed with limited resources so that God’s people could be free to make wise choices before the Lord for their personal duties and to be responsible for the consequences of their choices. However, when people do not believe in God and eternity, for example Americans in USA or Chinese in PRC, their only hope is on earth in this life. Therefore, a person is no longer an indispensable member of the body of Christ, but a cell in the Leviathan (Job 3:8, Job 40:25–41:26, Psalm 74:14, Psalm 104:26 and Isaiah 27:1), and each cell is sacrificial for the health of the giant Leviathan. Therefore, “Big Government” like USA and PRC today will concentrate resources and take care of everything, believing that the smartest few are more woke establishments to get jobs done, that the highest-cleared few are more qualified and more secured to make decisions and build systems for the people than the simple demand and supply of a small government, and that the end justifies the means, believing that society can continue to progress and the world can unconditionally become a better place after continuous compromise and tolerance. Abraham Lincoln said, if US fails, it has to be a suicide from within, “At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.” But why don’t we pay attention to it anymore? </p>
<p>The majority believe, historically big governments have often been more efficient than small governments in terms of infrastructure construction, disaster relief, and oversea wars and currencies for state-sponsored enterprises’ interest, and state-sponsored enterprises’ interest equal to the interest of individual capital. But more often than not, they have made bold assumptions and violent implementations, causing people to trade freedom for benefits and become increasingly dependent on the government and the clearance of the government. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of people’s nature of thinking that they are “like God, knowing good and evil” (Genesis 3:5), the big government must use various forms of false prophets (most of the false prophets are popular athiests with a PhD degree) to implement thought control, and ultimately use satan’s thoughts to achieve the goal of Tower of Babel. That’s why God warned us, in the unity of Tower of Babel, all the people together “worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?” (Revelation 13:4). Therefore, big governments such as USA and PRC are actually the Antichrist imitating the rule of Christ, replacing the Kingdom of God with a counterfeit Kingdom of Heaven and earth. Today in 21st century, with the development of overproduction, socialist capital, globalization, welfare society, digital payment, big data, artificial intelligence, and network censorship, the world has formed a huge “socialist + state-influenced capital + state-operated technology + state-interested media + unintelligent entertainment. The athiest humanistic combination of education and politics makes it increasingly possible for a Leviathan-style big government to control the world as One World Order. Maybe it is not a conspiracy, but just, even worse, an evil manifestation created by the gullible majority.</p>
<p>Do we choose just one Wedding of the Lamb, or repeat the Seven Trumpets? I believe God told me He has given us free will to decide, but many of us didn’t get the memo.</p>
