      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="Burning-to-revengence"><a href="#Burning-to-revengence" class="headerlink" title="Burning to revengence."></a>Burning to revengence.</h1><p>Charred, dark ground I standed. I am still stunned at this moment. I couldn’t believe what I just saw.</p><p>He is a famous mage of this country. Edwin, famous for his anecdotes. </p><p>“You heard that?<br>-The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.-<br>Fuck as hell.<br>So this world is a hell of shit.<br>I gonna do the good,<br>to cleanse this fallen hell of shit.”</p><p>He loves beauties. He said “the beauties is my batteries, and you know nothing about my energy”. </p><p>He loves cute ladies, and cute ladies love him, too. They call him “hot boy”. He is pretty proud of his ability of ejaculation delay. And, aye, he is really “hot”, too, if you know what I mean. </p><p>Yet I know nothing about his energy, though I know how fearful about his thermodynamics. He seemed capable to melt everything if he wills, as he always said, “In my flame, I cleanse”</p><p>Back to then, he passed by this meadow to waterfall, waving and saying hello to me, when I was walking onto an attraction. This place is one of the most beautiful point of attractions in this area, well known for its wet and warm weather, good fruits and flowers, and largest waterfalls in the nation, if not in the world. </p><p>But this place is as well also dangerous now, after the fallen warlock Mahalazhiah came and cursed, despite not completely, that’s why we are still here. Yet, in most of cases, beasts became demons, and plants became imps and infernos. If you are unlucky enough, you die no matter what. But again, this is beautiful attraction. Who doesn’t like beauties? whether in a woman, or in an attraction.</p><p>This is profound and arcane. But anyway.</p><p>But suddenly, “I smellt magic in the air. Hurry, Fred. “ Edwin said unto me.</p><p>Yet it was too late. I might be the very unlucky guy today. I must die, for I found so many demons and infernos suddenly appeared on my right side. I can tell they were irnormal type of them!</p><p>You can’t know how dangerous the bears near me. They each weight more than 2000lb due to the magic, and they are creul, violent, and very speedy. I can’t count at that time because it was too fearful, but at least 20 were there I can tell. </p><p>Also a bunch of huge truncks were standing there. They were not usual and idle truncks you thought. They can move, by the magic, and they are danguerous. And I heard the stories about the truncks. When they blow your brains out from your nose and eyes, they smash and squeeze your head and bones. </p><p>And now I am dead, I know! No chance! I got too near, as I didn’t pay attention…</p><p>“Fuck you stupid kid, Fred. What are you doing?”</p><p>He drew his left hand, pulling me onto him… What?</p><p>Then with sparks in his right hand, he seemed to tremble and shake the earth?! then … oh man, that was a meteor in the sky? Very huge that kind of meteor! In total red colour.  </p><p>Before the huge stone lands, the land was already melting in flames, and bears and truncks burned at once… Interestingly, I am safe, as if I am invincible, after I was “pulled” by Edwin. </p><p>Then… Boom.</p><p>…<br>…<br>…</p><p>When I next time opened my eyes, he said “Next time I said hurry. Be hurry. Fuck you, Fred. I had wasted bunch of time doing lawsuits for my family these days, due to their stupidity! Don’t waste more my time! “ </p><p>Here became even wetter and warmer ever since. Then he went away, leaving only dark and charred ground. Everything disappeared… aye, I said <em>everything</em>, including the river and the waterfall… They were all gone, if not evaporated, cremated.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="Blood-was-dripping-from-his-hands"><a href="#Blood-was-dripping-from-his-hands" class="headerlink" title="Blood was dripping from his hands"></a>Blood was dripping from his hands</h1><p>The Blood was dripping from his hands. </p><p>His eyes were cold. In front of him, a myriad of body parts from something -large monstres you can tell- scattered. Usually, you don’t see such coldness in front of this shocking scene. </p><p>But again, his eyes were cold, as cold as ice, as if they could freeze you or devour you. </p><p>Back to then, a man, appearing impotent, was walking on the dust bowl of desert. He appeared so impotent as to be signified ironically, for you’d wondered how he survived in this dry, cold and dangerous land. </p><p>This land is famous for many kinds of monstres and beasts. Cruel as hell, some bartenders rediculed. </p><p>While the walking, the earth trembled, and the cracks widened. In lightening speed, a tentacle of unknown monstre attacked from the darkness of the cracks, along with dark and evil energy, unto this poor and impotent guy. </p><p>“He was too weak to survive.” I thought. He even wasn’t well armed with regular sets and cloths as everybody else. A fat weak merchant civilian can look 100 times more robust than he! How can this impotent guy survive?  </p><p>If you were there, I doubt you’d open the eyes. But I did. To my surprise, this guy wasn’t tored apart imediately. What? He disappeared in my sight for a while. </p><p>“Hmm..mm..mm..” I only heared this mumbling. </p><p>The cracks widened even worse, and they are burning with white and green glimmers. </p><p>In fact, white and green winds blew everywhere during that moment. </p><p>Then I saw a cut -if not blew and blasted- tentacle painfully bleeding in dark colour. That guy showed up, and was in the kicking pose, idle. It appeared that this impotent guy knew how to kick, and the kick burned and blasted the huge tentacle like fairytells. </p><p>Suddenly, I couldn’t believe what I saw. Then he looked at me. </p><p>I knew this guy. His name is Rudi.</p><p>He said “my body is my weapon, so does my mind” unto me many years ago. I thought that was a joke. Now I was the witness of this joke. </p><p>Then he said, “how art thou?”</p><p>“How are you? That’s dangerous by the way… oh no!”</p><p>Sudden a monstruous claw attacked him from the underneath, that he couldn’t dodge or parry. </p><p>The monstre must still be alive, and very angry, revengeful, after the hazard. </p><p>The claw was so big, full of blades, and the blades were in the flesh and bone of Rudi, everywhere in his body.</p><p>Then Rudi bended over, gripping the claw with his arms and chest, a vertical “yoga” movement. </p><p>He spinned his waist -yellow glow this time- then the claw blasted, tore apart -a huge cracking and loud bang!</p><p>Now the monstre fully presented in the air, indeed with a cut tentacle and a cut claw. Only pain, revenge and rage are in its face -if you’d call such thing as a face.</p><p>“Hmm” Rudi mumbled. In fact, I wondered if I actually heard that sound. Or it was I imagined. I could hardly read what was like- perhaps “have..at..thee” in mumbling?</p><p>After the mumbling, several kicks and fists landed upon this large monstre. I wondered if the kicks were blades, and the fists were spears, because they created a foggy mist, a foggy mist of monstre’s dark blood, and body parts flew everywhere.</p><p>What were the shinbone and fingerbones made of? I thought bones were fragile… at least in my body. Let alone Rudi looks so weak and impotent. </p><p>Then he said “farewell my friend”</p><p>Before he left, his blood was still dripping from his countless wounds. He appeared more than calm. “You don’t want to feel my pain, for you can bear it not. “ I recalled what he said several years ago. Maybe this is so-called “staggering” of the damage for a monk. </p><p>Then I never saw him again. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="Puritan-love-and-Composure"><a href="#Puritan-love-and-Composure" class="headerlink" title="Puritan love and Composure"></a>Puritan love and Composure</h1><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/2qLL3M8.png" alt=""><br>Today I have the honor of re-introducing you to 彭紫雲/ 彭楊統妹, born respectively 11/29/1917 and 05/11/1919, a high school teacher and a housewife who were the backbones for a humble and ordinary family.  We are here today to reminisce about the lives and legacy they had on this earth with a simple rule: “puritan love and composure”.<br>My grandparents had 6 grand offspring: Cindy, Tina, 欣婷, 峻彥, 峻浩, 君婷 from three children of their own, 月琴 尚清 尚賢（喬洋）. Though my grandpa wasn’t an education major, he taught English, science and other subjects for many years as a respected high school teacher.  Also, even though my grandma didn’t have much formal education,  she was an avid reader and great cook and she surely nourished the family even more than the prudent.</p><p>Their marriage started from the Hakka pledge of so-called “child bride daughter”, before grandpa went to Japan to study Engineering and English, working for the Mitsui Group during WWII,  while grandma was here caring for their elderly parents. Just as Japan surrendered, grandpa ended his career as the director of Mitsui Group in Taiwan, starting his career as a high school teacher, while grandma continued caring for the family.<br>Along with their lives, they cared for and loved their children, grandchildren, brothers, sisters, neighbours and friends  with their puritan disciplines.  Since they lived during the war years, they did not pursue material gains, arts and entertainment  of any sort and instead focused  on sponsoring and helping others.  Even under the strictest standard of hardline Hakka tradition, they were demonstrably humble, diligent, frugal and kind-hearted.</p><p>Many banters and anecdotes remained. Occasionally they bickered that they were “fed up with each other” like every couple, but they steadfastly  spent their entire  lives together.<br>By and by before 5/31/2010, grandma would tell my grandpa, “I dislike you! Leave me alone! “ When my grandpa passed away, she mourned “I dislike you because you dared to leave me alone!” – That is their life of the spirit in one flesh.<br>Grandparents are great mentors of life.  I slept in the same room with grandma until I was ten years old, mentored by both of them day and night. They always encouraged me to pursue goodness rather than greatness, saying this was a key requirement in pursuing true happiness and peace.<br>I was somewhat  retarded in my speaking ability until later in life, so my grandpa taught me mathematics, physics and painting  earlier on around the age of  6, and my grandma had me respect every spirit. They educated me with wit and strategy. For example, when I was 7 years old,  my grandpa deliberately splashed water on me, teasing me to cry angrily, then had me calm down,  saying that anger is an evil spirit.  This valuable lesson I remember until today, as my grandma always shared the same insight, inventing similar profound lessons.<br>I never knew how lucky I was to have them in my life with all of those precious enlightenments and teachings.  When they left for heaven, their righteousness and altruism–their puritan love and composure–is their legacy that will always endure with every life they touched on this earth. Those were the wonderful grandparents that I knew, respected and loved.</p><p>In commemoration them  both 5/31/2010 and 5/7/2018</p><figure class="highlight mipsasm"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment"># <span class="doctag">Note:</span> </span></span><br><span class="line">彭紫雲 péng zǐ yún<span class="comment">; </span></span><br><span class="line">彭楊統妹 péng yáng tǒng mèi<span class="comment">; </span></span><br><span class="line">欣婷 xīn tíng<span class="comment">; </span></span><br><span class="line">峻彥 chùn yàn<span class="comment">; </span></span><br><span class="line">峻浩 chùn hào<span class="comment">; </span></span><br><span class="line">君婷 chūn tíng<span class="comment">;</span></span><br><span class="line">月琴 yuè qín<span class="comment">; </span></span><br><span class="line">尚清 <span class="keyword">shàng </span>qīng<span class="comment">; </span></span><br><span class="line">尚賢<span class="keyword">shàng </span>xián<span class="comment">; </span></span><br><span class="line">喬洋 qiáo yáng<span class="comment">;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>]]></content:encoded>
