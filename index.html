          <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>The monk is on a horseback, raiding. Much warmer, and the sky is blue, but not purple as usual. </p>
<p>Tis different nation. But he remained his confidence in eyes, suggesting his former presence here. </p>
<p>The sun shined the robe. But unlike conventional robe -silky and light-colour- dark dirts upon it are the only thing drizzling. But this monk can’t care less.</p>
<p>“Ah, my nippy sweetie, here”</p>
<p>He stopped by in front of a large tree, confident and familiar. He gently swept the soil. Interestingly, the soil flipped and waved, until a cask showed. </p>
<p>He took out the cask from the soil, sniffing a bit around the rotating cask. </p>
<p>“Good enough” if not mumbling. </p>
<p>This cask looks heavy -and it’s large- not until the monk toyed it like this. </p>
<p>Then he roped the cask on his back, back to the journey. </p>
<p>He is used to dryness and coldness on the North. But it seems to him that he addapt this rather warmer and wetter airs much quicker. During the night -the time belongs to starts and moon- he let moon and stars shine upon his beaming while he sitting, calm and cold. You don’t know whether he slept or not. </p>
<hr>
<p>“Behold, your thing is too big to be allowed in the town.”</p>
<p>The other day, the guard for the gate stopped the monk.</p>
<p>“Greeting sir. But tis important. “</p>
<p>“Important for what? “</p>
<p>“Important for me to get in with my carry-on. “</p>
<p>“No. Layman. You can’t. You don’t listen. Take it off. Now. “</p>
<p>“Sorry sir. “ Then he leid down the cask.</p>
<p>“Take it in. You four. “</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>4 heaviest soldiers went to rope it, after that, they sought to lift it, until they couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Too heavy. Sir. “</p>
<p>“Then break it. “</p>
<p>“No, please. “ Rudi begged them, but they ignored. They prepared biggest hammers. 1-2-3, they drummed it, and again, and again, until the hammers split. </p>
<p>That’s strange, not only the robustness of the cask, but also the splits of the hammers- they seemed frozen.</p>
<p>“How dare you? Another unlicensed mage? Tie him. “</p>
<p>“Yes sir. “ Spellbreakers came out from the shadow - they are one of the fearful enemy for mage in this world. They can intervene and <em>devour</em> spells, metally torturing any caster in front of them, when magic chains in their hands.</p>
<p>“No please sir… “</p>
<p>“And you four, prepare enhanced siege tool to smash this crap. “</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>Just as spellbreakers got near, with magic chains in hands, Rudi palmed right cheek of each spellbreaker in lightening speed. </p>
<p>“What? oh..”</p>
<p>Interestingly, they seemed paralysed, if not frozen.</p>
<p>“Shame on you. Killer! Try to kill all of us during the war time. How pethetic! “ The commander yelp.</p>
<p>“Ye art not dead, gentlemen. Let alone the fact that you attacked first. I will no trouble. “</p>
<p>“We are the justice. And you don’t abide by the law here. You don’t belong here. “</p>
<p>“Indeed you can define your justice. I am sorry again. But as I said, I will no trouble. “ Rudi replied.</p>
<p>“Sir we can’t break the cask with even +6 smashing machine. “</p>
<p>“This must be a conspiracy. You hide something from us. Mage. “</p>
<p>“Whatever you say sir. I want my time, and you play your bet. “</p>
<p>“Watch your words. Gambling is not allowed here.”</p>
<p>“Aye, not allowed here, for laymen like us, but not for you sirs. Every single day, you sirs gamble everything, such as my cask, for no reason. “</p>
<p>“I am the law. How dare you? Civilian. “</p>
<p>“Definitely. And I dare not, don’t get me wrong. I will no troubles. “ </p>
<p>“Your words don’t align with your actions. You hurt my people, and agitated me. “ </p>
<p>“I follow your judgement. But again, I want to have my time, and you have your bets and gambling. Peace. “</p>
<p>“My judgement is you should be put to death. “</p>
<p>“Everyday for me is dead. I am already dead, before frost soothed me. “</p>
<p>“You are too prideful. You dare to speak the nonsense before God. You have no God in your deceitful heart. “</p>
<p>“God said He will punish bad officials and princes, but not put His wrath upon us helpless civilians. “</p>
<p>“And you also slandered me, the law, saying us gamblers. “</p>
<p>“For I can read your mind. “</p>
<p>“Prideful pig. “</p>
<p>“Thank you. And I am leaving, with my keg indeed. “</p>
<p>“This guy calls this huge cask a keg. What’s wrong with his mind? “ a paralysed spellbreaker thought. </p>
<p>“Now, snipers. “</p>
<p>Just as the monk bowed, paused to move his foot, three bullets flied and stroke from his right side, unto his head.</p>
<p>The bullets were made of enhanced dark iron. This material is pretty dense, so as to accelerate the speed. </p>
<p>The monk doesn’t have time to dodge, let alone during bowing. Dark iron can transform into any most deadly weapons on the earth, let alone enhanced by magic. </p>
<p>However, no oozing, nor bleeding, as they indeed hit the target. The monk’s skin seemed to catch the three bullets, if not freeze them. </p>
<p>“Don’t stir the water. Just calm down. “ Rudi said, as his left hand grab all the bullets from his head. </p>
<p>And he tread, if not tremble the ground, before he breathes a deep green fog, around the air. The texture of the mist was not usual water, but something similar to alcohol, if not stronger than alcohol. And it smelled good, but freezing cold. </p>
<p>“Stupid.. bare-head.. willy.. “ the commander put. The soldiers, along with the commander, started disoriented, slowed down, and cool. </p>
<p>“Drink before you drive. Drive crazy not. Just calm and maintain. Gentleman. “ Rudi murmured to himself, for he knew nobody listening. </p>
<p>Then he rode on, with his huge “keg” carried on the back, as if nothing happened. Wind blew, freezing-cold.  </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Then he stopped by a lake, as if seeing something. </p>
<p>Warmer, heated, as the airs put. A large fireball rushed -he dodged not- onto the ground near him. He knew that. </p>
<p>“Well. It has been a long time. “</p>
<p>“Hey trashy monk. Why didn’t you die? “</p>
<p>“Ah I got our nice whisky. I distilled it with a keg made of iced pelatumba wood and soft mass-dense ironised coal, put it under the grillian tree. And you don’t want to know where the malt from. No kidding. “</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t want to know every your engineering shit. “</p>
<p>“Anyhow, prepare to enjoy your life now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my life is like shit. “ Edwin replied shortly, with his higher, energetic pitch. </p>
<p>“Don’t say that. Be positive. “ calmly, as Rudi opened the keg, collecting some golden fluid. </p>
<p>“You knew. Buddy. We are trash. “</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. We are good, at least right at this moment. “</p>
<p>“Fuck this world. I just feel…” Edwin said, as as the nip of Edwin’s share was warmed all at once. “ANGRY…”</p>
<p>“Aye, everyday can be frustrated. “ Rudi replied.</p>
<p>“It turns out that girl only wastes my time. Although she is cute, I don’t want to fuck her anymore. “ Edwin quaffed. “Oh fuck you stupid kid. This is too spicy too strong. “</p>
<p>“Sip, thou shalt, instead. Ha ha look at you. “ Rudi beamed, after he quaffed. </p>
<p>“You have no taste. Man. Why don’t you make wine or beer? “ Edwin said. </p>
<p>“Did you hear I brew wine or beer? Not to my ability. “ </p>
<p>“Anyway, that girl.. she is my type. Small in height, around 152 cm, big boobs, around 34F, and very hot and alluring in her traits, man, as she touched me, I got hard on! You knew my power and strength. Oh, I didn’t eject last night. What a shame. I feel really angry. “ </p>
<p>“Aye sometimes you just can’t. “</p>
<p>“I wanted to cum, but something wasn’t right last night. Her attitude. At the final posture -I went from her behind- I could tell she didn’t concentrate on our matter. What the hell. “</p>
<p>“Aye, bloody hell. “</p>
<p>“Yeah! She didn’t respect me, nor respect our love making. That’s.. frustrated. Women always disappoint me. What have I done, as every end of my relationship comes to this? “</p>
<p>“Do you love her? “ </p>
<p>“I like her body. Small body and big boobs, you knew. She is like a toy of my penis. I can control her solely by my penis and my magic. Inside her, my penis is so warm, greasy. She is wet too. All the time, even until she showed her reluctance, her pussy was wet as hell. And she is really cute, passionate. I also enjoyed her moaning. “</p>
<p>“Copulatory vocalisations. “</p>
<p>“Yeah, her moaning was like singing, rhymed by the root of my penis. My penis is the baton of the music, the authority of her small and fit body, and her vagina is my territory. “</p>
<p>“Ok. “</p>
<p>“But I didn’t cum. And I am not happy now. “</p>
<p>“Sip and forget. “</p>
<p>“Fuck that. Fuck that girl. And I don’t want to fuck her again. “</p>
<p>“Calm and forget. “ Rudi said onto the mage of rage. </p>
<p>Then the mage sipped, and made a deep breath, the plates on his chest moving, rhymed with his breath. </p>
<p>His plates look pretty robust, but not that heavy, at least to his movement eligible to the should-be-heavy plates. </p>
<p>“You see my ring and mace are still bright. So do my plates. I clean them everyday. I like heavy metals. “ </p>
<p>“By water? “</p>
<p>“No, by my cleanse spells. “</p>
<p>“Oh, you meant your flames. “</p>
<p>“Yeah. The surface and the solid should be treated in different processes. I got a lot of magic to do for their beauty. You knew, I concern the beauty the most. “</p>
<p>“Aye, you are the artist. “</p>
<p>“People thought I am a paladin by my plates when I am the better wizard. And in fact not only wizard I am but also an artist. “</p>
<p>“Whole world is my canvas, as you said. “</p>
<p>“That’s right! That’s who I am. That’s what I do! Oh man. But this world is a crap, especially after they came. “</p>
<p>“Ok. Sip. “</p>
<p>“Yeah. I like your beverage, soothing my heart always. But why you always brewed drink of such strong alcohol. This would just shade its beauty and flavour. You know nothing about arts. “</p>
<p>“Well. To my limit. “ The monk quaffed again, adding “I want to call this one The Frozen Heart. How do you like the name? “</p>
<p>“Whatever. But I don’t appreciate your old-school style of naming anyway. “</p>
<p>“Hah. High way to hell. “ Rudi replied with a smile. </p>
<p>“Hell of shit. “</p>
<p>“Bloody hell. “ coldly he mumbled. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>This was the other day of fogs. Cloudy a bit, but no rains in prospect. </p>
<p>“Dominating” Rudi said, as they watched the fighters among gladiators in an arena. They were slaves fighting for their freedom. Usually, it’s quite brutal. This nation has layers of layers for gladiators -or champions, whatever they say- and this game is not in the major leagues. </p>
<p>“You knew. If I were he, I fuck them with fire balls. Or just scorch them with my gazes and breath. “</p>
<p>“Aye I knew you would. “</p>
<p>“You can also put them in your storm of fists and legs. Man, you are the juicer. “</p>
<p>“I don’t know. “</p>
<p>“You already knew. You are the juicer, freezing them below zero, and blasting them into snowflakes. “ </p>
<p>“Ah. Ha ha. After all, we are the symphony of snows and flames. “ Rudi added, delightfully.</p>
<p>In this world, the reproduction of human kinds is pretty short, about only 6 months. So there are big populations among all the nations in this world, despite endless warfares recently, and constant combats as entertainment. Some competitions, especially in major leagues, have good magical protections upon the champions for their safety, for after all, they are freemen who fight for their ethnicity, group, company, guild, or even just for profits. But those slaves today don’t have that luck, though some of them have the potentials for advance in higher level, if they can walk out of the arena with full limbs. Yes, if one lost limbs, likely he’d not come back to the arena, let alone contracts between any team. </p>
<p>“So until now, for hours, where are they?! ”</p>
<p>“I thought they will come. ”</p>
<p>“Which they didn’t. You are wrong. ”</p>
<p>“We can enjoy the game, after all. ”</p>
<p>“Frustrated! I want some wine under Turtutoriotrits on the south after today’s boringness. ”</p>
<p>“Oh, I miss that place too. ”</p>
<p>“Yeah, one of best bars on the earth. Owned by some cool Tortollan guys. Their jokes and music are better than other bards and bartenders. ”</p>
<p>“Aye they really got that talent. Brev, I really want to be a tortollan. With that shell, I can do anything, at least I can join their cute league. ”</p>
<p>“No you can’t. Stupid. You are just a piece of monk, knowing nothing about arts. ”</p>
<p>“Aye, a piece of monk. ”</p>
<p>“We have pathetic lives, sitting here waiting for nothing. Even if we succeed catching the demons, no one would thank us, for they all have demonic hearts. They just say, OH YOU TWO ARE FREAKS. This is the truth of this fallen evil world. ”</p>
<p>“Aye, I remember last time, they said what the hell are ya? A monk in grubby gears, and a mage in stupid plates? And they kept saying that. Mayhaps this is their way of thanksgiving. ”</p>
<p>“And my weapons are mace and ring. I don’t give a shit of their comments. I am who I am. ” Edwin replied. </p>
<p>“Aye, you are the iron man, if not harder than iron. ”</p>
<p>“I am even harder when I am hard on. Indeed, I need a cute girl for the hard ignition. ”</p>
<p>“Before she ignites your sorrows after your sex. ”</p>
<p>“Oh man. You are totally right. ”</p>
<p>“Brilliant. ” </p>
<p>“And I hate that. ”</p>
<p>“Look. ”</p>
<p>Then one gladiator was mutilated by a deadly slash, as his arm flew thru the air, spreading blood everywhere, as the arteries were cut loose neatly. His opponent looked like a pretty good daggers swinger, while he is not stabbing type, but a slashing type, who uses tricky angle of dual daggers to cut flesh and bones neatly like scissors on the principle of leverage. This type of swordsman have agility and strength. </p>
<p>“As blood came out, temptation will arrive. “ Rudi commented, just as the crowd yelled and hailed ironically joyous, if not cruel. </p>
<p>“The people get me sick. ” Edwin sighed. </p>
<p>“Any blood, from vanguard or from sole entertainment, contributes the Thirsty. ”</p>
<p>“They can’t care less. “</p>
<p>The crowd yelled even louder. Some started to yelp, “Kill him. Kill him. This maggot should be eviscerated. ” “Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! “ They are passionate, happy, but ironically hateful, as they breathed such words in joyous manners. They didn’t know why, but they are more than normal. Maybe some of them thought this is just for fun. Let alone judging people is always more than fun. </p>
<p>Who are the audiences? They are good-behavioured and educated civilians, most of them are scholars, bankers or top businessmen in this town -no everyone can afford the price of a game in arena, let alone donations usually mandatory- but when they were in situation like this, they always showed such kind of traits. Perhaps this is just a nature of human, blood thirsty, as people kept denying on their education systems. And now, some warlock agency takes advantage of this human nature for their profits. Again, warlocks are also decent professions in this age. Decent people always have decent way to collect the dirtiest money. </p>
<p>“But I am not swallowing it. I am angry. “ Edwin said. </p>
<p>“I knew. But we need evidence. That’s why we are here. ”</p>
<p>“Yeah I knew. I am the lawyer. But I want to burn them after I humiliate them in the court. ”</p>
<p>“Aye we can. ”</p>
<p>“Fuck them. ” Edwin said. </p>
<p>In the academia of the magic, there are 7 orthodox schools in classical, or old school, classification. They are, Adjuration for protecting, Conjuration for Summoning, Divination for detecting, Enchantment for controlling, Evocation for element arts, Illustration for imaging, Necromancy for life manipulations. That’s why we usually said a good mage is a “Master of Seven Arts”. In a more modern classification, some universities divide the knowledge body of magic into Fire, Ice, Arcane, Lightening, Chaos, in lieu of old-school 7 arts system, for combat pragmatism -or so-called specialisations system- such that trainee can focus on one. </p>
<p>“You knew. I am a genius of fire. I casted my first fireball when I was two years old. Usually, even academical genius learn to control the fire after their 18. ” Edwin shared.</p>
<p>“Aye you said that before. ”</p>
<p>“And you knew what? All the mage educations are pussy. I am the hard on, so I do no pussy, despite attending Omegamanism University, best magical university in the world we know. Finally I came out a way to cast magic from my fury and wrath -I call it my rage system- but not any more from concentration system that conventional people use. That was pathetic system. ”</p>
<p>“And you focus on fire. ”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Any other specialisation is just toy to me. “</p>
<p>“At least not to your talent, for you are the fire guy. And you wear plates. “</p>
<p>“That’s right. I am the fire guy. I can visualise my emotion, evoking them into actual fires and flames. And I wear plates. I am awesome. ”</p>
<p>“Aye, thou art. “</p>
<p>“They do evading, blinking, wanding that kind of crap. I got my fire dash. I use my Force and my Fire. F&amp;F. ”</p>
<p>“Aye you are one of the best wizards. And you marched your own path. You can’t care less about Master of Seven Arts. ”</p>
<p>“Because I am better than they. “</p>
<p>“You are the iron man who melts the enemy. “</p>
<p>“That’s right! That’s who I am! And it’s an irony that body of mage is fragile when mage still insists to wear clothes rather than plates. They train no their buts, having no brains. ”</p>
<p>“But I knew you can’t endure attacks, even if you wear plates. “</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, you are my cover. You read, shade and heal pains and attacks for me, as I cleanse the offenders. “</p>
<p>“They are nothing before you. You don’t need endurance. You just hurt them and destroy them. ”</p>
<p>“That’s right. That’s who I am. “ Edwin said proudly. </p>
<p>Now that the monk read a pretty offensive draining force in the airs, perhaps due to some warlock’s Business Curse, as it collected <em>Thirsty</em> energy. The conversion rate of energy storage wasn’t good enough at this time. But this field of study already attracted the eyes of many seed investors, for the early adapters also thought the Thirsty Energy Transformed Magical Storage is a big plus for their lives as well as their careers. If the business practitioners -the warlocks- can grow their business and sell it, it’s a good business model no matter what. They can’t care less about the conversion rate and the pragmatism, if their ideas are brilliant product market fit. </p>
<p>“They are doing it,” said the monk.</p>
<p>“And we are stopping them,” replied the mage. </p>

          <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>So the monk read the air, with his peace of mind. </p>
<p>“Tell me, vitualising it. “</p>
<p>“I can put it unto your head, but I can’t vitualise it, for I am not a mage like you. “</p>
<p>“Come on. But I need see that with my eyes. My damage can only be done one hundred percents with good sights. “</p>
<p>“Maybe that direction. I am not sure. They are using demonic gateway for their virtual private networks, where I cannot penetrate into, let alone telling you properly and precisely. “ Rudi played his mustache and beard thin as he explained. </p>
<p>“Then if you do it, I cannot fully cover you with my fire. You will be damaged hugely before I can see and fire. “</p>
<p>“I born to endure damage. No worry. “</p>
<p>“Man. You are <em>Bald</em>. “</p>
<p>“Aye my bald head is the answer. “</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s do it. “</p>
<p>Then the monk started to reveal their intents with his <em>Eye of Mind</em>. He freezed some Thirsty Enegy in the air, along with the <em>tracer ruins</em> ejected by his Chi. He ejected his Chi to show the presence of both ends, such that he let Edwin the lawyer prove about Warlocks collecting energy from human sins upon a bloody events.</p>
<p>But in this nation, everyone has the right to kill if they get the balls and power. This in the law is the Principle of Self Protection. So the warlocks arm themselves with destruction spells. If they can kill the invaders and cage all the evidence seekers, they can provide their innocence, no matter what people think of them. </p>
<p>Let alone their good reputation and decent privilege. In fact, it’s hard to be a mage or a warlock, as so many laymen send their children studying magic. But usually warlocks are higher caste by family background, compare to what middleclass as to mage -indeed, only if they succeed- only 0.1% of all the trainees finally make it as a mage or a warlock. Again, this is a very challenging study and career. It needs a lot of efforts and training. After study, many nations require magic practitioners -so-called mage or warlocks- to have at least 3 years clinical training by a certified institute before they can sit in the bar for Licensed Magic Practitioner Test. </p>
<p>Now, the monk was <em>hacking</em> the access point of energy transportation with his freezing kick. He already collected many tracer ruins -his data and records for evidence of Edwin’s case- in this access point. Now he only need to take it with them. </p>
<p>“Bald falk. Don’t you know how many traps are here? I knew so many people want our business secrets. But no one like you just walks in. “</p>
<p>“I can’t hide before the eyes you put, so I hide not. “ The monk replied. </p>
<p>“Good point. But still, you need lay down. “</p>
<p>The warlock started to cast magic before the monk, as monk was stunned by a demonological trap. At least, he should, in fact, he wasn’t at all stunned, to the warlock’s surprise. </p>
<p>The whole atmosphere was darken, broken for eyesights, as if they were in another matrics of dimensions set. So Edwin can do nothing. This is a Time Wraaper Zone. </p>
<p>“Arise!”</p>
<p>Just as a bolt came from the warlock, spiraling and sinking, a pair of demonic claws <em>flowered</em> from underneath of the monk. </p>
<p>“I can’t stun you with my trap, but you will be slowed by my other spells, eating my bolt thereby. This is an art. You have no where to wrong. “ the warlock thought.</p>
<p>As he predicted, the bolt hit the target, causing a shadow swirl around the body of the monk. He was burn with dark fire, infected by the darkness, oozing dark blood. </p>
<p>But the swirl and the wound started to “slow down”, as if they were frozen. </p>
<p>“Frozen flesh can grant me peace. “ He couldn’t mitigate the pains, but could just take it as nothing. </p>
<p>Then the damage was staggered and frozen. </p>
<p>“You are a monstre, aren’t you? “ The warlock started to scortch him with dark fire. </p>
<p>“No. But just a monk, or a hermit. “ The monk again took the pains, swallowing them with his frozen flesh, staggering, as he finally walked near the warlock, and stroke with his powerful left fist. </p>
<p>He was expecting a knockout as he hit, but nothing happened. </p>
<p>The warlock blinked into another position, <em>kiting</em> this monk. Dark infections and dark burnings were still active onto the monk, despite frozen and staggered.</p>
<p>He could endure the pains, but it doesn’t mean the pains were tolerable and bearable! It’s about one million times the feeling of a woman giving birth. Tis why victims of such spells usually get stunned and feared. </p>
<p>He maintained his best to calm his painful mind, thinking about rivers and mountains. He knew, he had to hit at least three times in a raw -hard enough indeed- to actually hurt and stop the warlock.</p>
<p>This warlock enhanced and continuously manipulated the infections and scortch on the monk. If it’s conventional fighter or something -even the bravest- they can just run away or beg before the warlock for stopping. But he just calmly walked like a wind, near and near to the warlock. </p>
<p>“I am the supply chain manager. Don’t mess with me. “ The warlock said unto the painful monk. </p>
<p>“And your systems have many vulnerabilities. “ He threw the combination, finally. An uppercut hit the liver of the warlock. “And I study them. “ The monk added. </p>
<p>The warlock blinked again, back to the original position. But he feels his body and mind slowed down, if not frozen, as if he was <em>poisoned by the coldness</em>. </p>
<p>“You don’t… know my… power. I can… immolate… you. “</p>
<p>“And I can investigate you. My friend would sue you. “ Coldly the monk replied.</p>
<p>The warlock sneered, and blinked into other position again, starting casting another unknown spell. Rudi thought, what is so-called immolate? Will this warlock sacrifice himself for a self-desctruction explosion? Not likely, for mages and warlocks fear death and pains the most. </p>
<p>So he started to read the warlock’s mind, but in vein as he efforted, for warlock can hide their minds if they pay attentions. No clues. Anyhow, he got near the warlock again -finally- freezing the spell with his silky cold breeze onto the emerging magical energy, from his right hook unto the face of warlock. He halted the casting, if not worse than that, as the warlock cannot even breathe at this moment, for he felt the air was too cold…</p>
<p>Then his body softened, his mind knew the warlock’s in danger. Left kick onto his face -not yet, for the devil guard was summoned by the amulet on his neck, blocking the kick. </p>
<p>The demon is very huge, about three times the height of Rudi, a monk of 178cm. The demon -she- blocked with her right wing, as she coiled into a shell like. </p>
<p>“How dare you. “ The warlock said. </p>
<p>“I knew you were too tired to blink again at that moment. “</p>
<p>“You don’t belong here. I could kill you. “</p>
<p>“You already tried with no mercy. I knew you couldn’t. “</p>
<p>“And you cannot hurt me. Monk. Your attacks are just too … puny, pethatic. “ Warlock mocked.</p>
<p>“Constant drippings wear away a stone. And your gateway is our testimony. “</p>
<p>“Over my dead body. “ Then the warlock started to cast again, as bright green covering orange colour sparked on his fanning palms. </p>
<p>The monk knew he must be quick. But he can only run and walk in front of this experienced warlock -windwalk kind of kungfu was already the fastest way to his limit, for he is not conventional rolling, flying, jumping and dancing kind of aggresive martial artists. He is the shield with no defect, but also the shield with no harm and slash. His head is more rock-solid than the heaviest-forged shield of a vindicated warrior or a paladin. That’s why -to him- he wears no arms, but just a shabby light cloth robe, without any single enhancement. </p>
<p>He knew he can’t just take the access point and run away, for warlock can mar him in any kind, even if he cannot kill him.</p>
<p>He wasn’t frustrated -by the mobility of the warlock- but indeed puzzled a lot. And he can hardly deal any significance. </p>
<p>“You are… a worthy opponent. “ The warlock put. </p>
<p>The combat continued another couple of minutes. There was, until then, no sign of ending. </p>

          <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="Burning-to-revengence"><a href="#Burning-to-revengence" class="headerlink" title="Burning to revengence."></a>Burning to revengence.</h1><p>Charred, dark ground I standed. I am still stunned at this moment. I couldn’t believe what I just saw.</p>
<p>He is a famous mage of this country. Edwin, famous for his anecdotes. </p>
<p>“You heard that?<br>-The Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.-<br>Fuck as hell.<br>So this world is a hell of shit.<br>I gonna do the good,<br>to cleanse this fallen hell of shit.”</p>
<p>He loves beauties. He said “the beauties is my batteries, and you know nothing about my energy”. </p>
<p>He loves cute ladies, and cute ladies love him, too. They call him “hot boy”. He is pretty proud of his ability of ejaculation delay. And, aye, he is really “hot”, too, if you know what I mean. </p>
<p>Yet I know nothing about his energy, though I know how fearful about his thermodynamics. He seemed capable to melt everything if he wills, as he always said, “In my flame, I cleanse”</p>
<p>Back to then, he passed by this meadow to waterfall, waving and saying hello to me, when I was walking onto an attraction. This place is one of the most beautiful point of attractions in this area, well known for its wet and warm weather, good fruits and flowers, and largest waterfalls in the nation, if not in the world. </p>
<p>But this place is as well also dangerous now, after the fallen warlock Mahalazhiah came and cursed, despite not completely, that’s why we are still here. Yet, in most of cases, beasts became demons, and plants became imps and infernos. If you are unlucky enough, you die no matter what. But again, this is beautiful attraction. Who doesn’t like beauties? whether in a woman, or in an attraction.</p>
<p>This is profound and arcane. But anyway.</p>
<p>But suddenly, “I smellt magic in the air. Hurry, Fred. “ Edwin said unto me.</p>
<p>Yet it was too late. I might be the very unlucky guy today. I must die, for I found so many demons and infernos suddenly appeared on my right side. I can tell they were irnormal type of them!</p>
<p>You can’t know how dangerous the bears near me. They each weight more than 2000lb due to the magic, and they are creul, violent, and very speedy. I can’t count at that time because it was too fearful, but at least 20 were there I can tell. </p>
<p>Also a bunch of huge truncks were standing there. They were not usual and idle truncks you thought. They can move, by the magic, and they are danguerous. And I heard the stories about the truncks. When they blow your brains out from your nose and eyes, they smash and squeeze your head and bones. </p>
<p>And now I am dead, I know! No chance! I got too near, as I didn’t pay attention…</p>
<p>“Fuck you stupid kid, Fred. What are you doing?”</p>
<p>He drew his left hand, pulling me onto him… What?</p>
<p>Then with sparks in his right hand, he seemed to tremble and shake the earth?! then … oh man, that was a meteor in the sky? Very huge that kind of meteor! In total red colour.  </p>
<p>Before the huge stone lands, the land was already melting in flames, and bears and truncks burned at once… Interestingly, I am safe, as if I am invincible, after I was “pulled” by Edwin. </p>
<p>Then… Boom.</p>
<p>…<br>…<br>…</p>
<p>When I next time opened my eyes, he said “Next time I said hurry. Be hurry. Fuck you, Fred. I had wasted bunch of time doing lawsuits for my family these days, due to their stupidity! Don’t waste more my time! “ </p>
<p>Here became even wetter and warmer ever since. Then he went away, leaving only dark and charred ground. Everything disappeared… aye, I said <em>everything</em>, including the river and the waterfall… They were all gone, if not evaporated, cremated.</p>

          <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="Blood-was-dripping-from-his-hands"><a href="#Blood-was-dripping-from-his-hands" class="headerlink" title="Blood was dripping from his hands"></a>Blood was dripping from his hands</h1><p>The Blood was dripping from his hands. </p>
<p>His eyes were cold. In front of him, a myriad of body parts from something -large monstres you can tell- scattered. Usually, you don’t see such coldness in front of this shocking scene. </p>
<p>But again, his eyes were cold, as cold as ice, as if they could freeze you or devour you. </p>
<p>Back to then, a man, appearing impotent, was walking on the dust bowl of desert. He appeared so impotent as to be signified ironically, for you’d wondered how he survived in this dry, cold and dangerous land. </p>
<p>This land is famous for many kinds of monstres and beasts. Cruel as hell, some bartenders rediculed. </p>
<p>While the walking, the earth trembled, and the cracks widened. In lightening speed, a tentacle of unknown monstre attacked from the darkness of the cracks, along with dark and evil energy, unto this poor and impotent guy. </p>
<p>“He was too weak to survive.” I thought. He even wasn’t well armed with regular sets and cloths as everybody else. A fat weak merchant civilian can look 100 times more robust than he! How can this impotent guy survive?  </p>
<p>If you were there, I doubt you’d open the eyes. But I did. To my surprise, this guy wasn’t tored apart imediately. What? He disappeared in my sight for a while. </p>
<p>“Hmm..mm..mm..” I only heared this mumbling. </p>
<p>The cracks widened even worse, and they are burning with white and green glimmers. </p>
<p>In fact, white and green winds blew everywhere during that moment. </p>
<p>Then I saw a cut -if not blew and blasted- tentacle painfully bleeding in dark colour. That guy showed up, and was in the kicking pose, idle. It appeared that this impotent guy knew how to kick, and the kick burned and blasted the huge tentacle like fairytells. </p>
<p>Suddenly, I couldn’t believe what I saw. Then he looked at me. </p>
<p>I knew this guy. His name is Rudi.</p>
<p>He said “my body is my weapon, so does my mind” unto me many years ago. I thought that was a joke. Now I was the witness of this joke. </p>
<p>Then he said, “how art thou?”</p>
<p>“How are you? That’s dangerous by the way… oh no!”</p>
<p>Sudden a monstruous claw attacked him from the underneath, that he couldn’t dodge or parry. </p>
<p>The monstre must still be alive, and very angry, revengeful, after the hazard. </p>
<p>The claw was so big, full of blades, and the blades were in the flesh and bone of Rudi, everywhere in his body.</p>
<p>Then Rudi bended over, gripping the claw with his arms and chest, a vertical “yoga” movement. </p>
<p>He spinned his waist -yellow glow this time- then the claw blasted, tore apart -a huge cracking and loud bang!</p>
<p>Now the monstre fully presented in the air, indeed with a cut tentacle and a cut claw. Only pain, revenge and rage are in its face -if you’d call such thing as a face.</p>
<p>“Hmm” Rudi mumbled. In fact, I wondered if I actually heard that sound. Or it was I imagined. I could hardly read what was like- perhaps “have..at..thee” in mumbling?</p>
<p>After the mumbling, several kicks and fists landed upon this large monstre. I wondered if the kicks were blades, and the fists were spears, because they created a foggy mist, a foggy mist of monstre’s dark blood, and body parts flew everywhere.</p>
<p>What were the shinbone and fingerbones made of? I thought bones were fragile… at least in my body. Let alone Rudi looks so weak and impotent. </p>
<p>Then he said “farewell my friend”</p>
<p>Before he left, his blood was still dripping from his countless wounds. He appeared more than calm. “You don’t want to feel my pain, for you can bear it not. “ I recalled what he said several years ago. Maybe this is so-called “staggering” of the damage for a monk. </p>
<p>Then I never saw him again. </p>

We are here today to reminisce about the lives and legacy they had on this earth with a simple rule: “puritan love and composure”.<br>My grandparents had 6 grand offspring: Cindy, Tina, 欣婷, 峻彥, 峻浩, 君婷 from three children of their own, 月琴 尚清 尚賢（喬洋）. Though my grandpa wasn’t an education major, he taught English, science and other subjects for many years as a respected high school teacher.  Also, even though my grandma didn’t have much formal education,  she was an avid reader and great cook and she surely nourished the family even more than the prudent.</p>
<p>Their marriage started from the Hakka pledge of so-called “child bride daughter”, before grandpa went to Japan to study Engineering and English, working for the Mitsui Group during WWII,  while grandma was here caring for their elderly parents. Just as Japan surrendered, grandpa ended his career as the director of Mitsui Group in Taiwan, starting his career as a high school teacher, while grandma continued caring for the family.<br>Along with their lives, they cared for and loved their children, grandchildren, brothers, sisters, neighbours and friends  with their puritan disciplines.  Since they lived during the war years, they did not pursue material gains, arts and entertainment  of any sort and instead focused  on sponsoring and helping others.  Even under the strictest standard of hardline Hakka tradition, they were demonstrably humble, diligent, frugal and kind-hearted.</p>
<p>Many banters and anecdotes remained. Occasionally they bickered that they were “fed up with each other” like every couple, but they steadfastly  spent their entire  lives together.<br>By and by before 5/31/2010, grandma would tell my grandpa, “I dislike you! Leave me alone! “ When my grandpa passed away, she mourned “I dislike you because you dared to leave me alone!” – That is their life of the spirit in one flesh.<br>Grandparents are great mentors of life.  I slept in the same room with grandma until I was ten years old, mentored by both of them day and night. They always encouraged me to pursue goodness rather than greatness, saying this was a key requirement in pursuing true happiness and peace.<br>I was somewhat  retarded in my speaking ability until later in life, so my grandpa taught me mathematics, physics and painting  earlier on around the age of  6, and my grandma had me respect every spirit. They educated me with wit and strategy. For example, when I was 7 years old,  my grandpa deliberately splashed water on me, teasing me to cry angrily, then had me calm down,  saying that anger is an evil spirit.  This valuable lesson I remember until today, as my grandma always shared the same insight, inventing similar profound lessons.<br>I never knew how lucky I was to have them in my life with all of those precious enlightenments and teachings.  When they left for heaven, their righteousness and altruism–their puritan love and composure–is their legacy that will always endure with every life they touched on this earth. Those were the wonderful grandparents that I knew, respected and loved.</p>
<p>In commemoration them  both 5/31/2010 and 5/7/2018</p>
