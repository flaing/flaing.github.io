          <span itemprop="articleBody"><p>People in ring fail to use basic principles. All the time. </p>
<p>My worst/ humblest weakness is my grappling, so let’s take it for example. I once grappled with a grappler in a national-level event. He wore a blackbelt something, preparing a fight. I said I could play with him. He said he doesn’t want to hurt me, but if I ask for it, so we started. When standup, I countered his takedown at first. But since he relentlessly wanted to take me down, I letted him execute legs takedown and I secured a closed guard on the ground. Then again, he focused relentlessly controlling my body, head. I heard that his lower body sometimes stood up, sometimes went back. He might think I would get him an armbar, so he focused on, relentlessly again, my upper body, including shoulders sometimes. When he was tired and hesitated, I swept him over, getting him an kimura and tilted my angle, then he tapped. After that he and his teammates excused that they focused only on gi, that they were very professional, and then asked my name, wanted to connect with me in facebook. </p>
<p>Aye, I don’t have any belt in grappling, but the world acted as if I am the lucky pastor, that people around him confessed their excuses. Why I won? I only applied basic principles in practices, as he only cared about wining. He wasn’t paying attention about guard’s space, as he tried all his energy to attempt a hold, and imagined I would trap him into armbar. In fact I don’t care about all that matters. I escaped by creating space. With space, I could do whatever I want: armbar or transform position. He wasn’t aware of space issue, but only focusing on submission attempts/ defenses that he thought he would succeed/ encounter, then I capitalised his ego and intent. </p>
<p><strong><em>By the way, Taiwanese fighters are always very prideful. In fact, they were encouraged acting like that. “Sometimes it’s good to be pride.” If you are American ring players who were encouraged to love and respect each other, you couldn’t imagine such a culture mentioned. </em></strong></p>
<p>So, why not learn so many tricks, but forget the basic principles? In fact, this applied also in technology, tinkering, hacking, programming, algorithms and data structures, if you know what I meant.</p>
<p>Again, to focus on basic principles is one of the most underestimated virtues. Hope this helpful. </p>

The reason, that I don’t fear any black belts in tkd, judo, kata, or bigger, stronger guys, or athletic boxing team opponents, is for their advantages – reflex actions, patterns, etc – sometimes lead to backfires. On the contrary, I have no setups or scenarios inherited directly from coaches or teachers; I am not full of muscles, nor good at conditioning; I was not at all a sport kid when I was young – no talent, I was a total geek who played no ball games. I survive because of some flows and methods concerning only realistic situations. And I am thanksful, for all friends, people, opponents, or even haters. Especially, thankful for my lifelong teacher –master Yu who offered me full sponsorship and his love when I was college. Also I am thankful that Forrest Griffin sparred with me, letting me understand what is one of the best UFC p4p bad arses in the world like!  (Of course, I am still more than willing to learn from anybody. Since I already got my PhD offer in Cyber Security, if I study in USA, I will back to cage no matter how busy. )</p>

This is one of the realest things in the world. Appearance doesn’t matter as much as other fields. To me it could be generalised into 5 frozen tips. With continuous visualisations, combinatrics drills, sparrings, trainings, fighters can focus on this only 5 goden tips in order of –when fighting– clearing their natural pressure and noise from their heads, so as to relax more, progress more, recover quicker. Here is my frozen tips about MMA:</p>
<ol>
<li>Strikes - all about timing and distance</li>
<li>Takedowns - all about breaking balance, and about yin-yang</li>
<li>Ground and pounds - all about ground and efficiency</li>
<li>Grappling -  all about nearness and smallness</li>
<li>Combining - all about utilising momentum and saving energy</li>
</ol>

<p>For some reasons, i don’t have this human nature, and i keep away from this human nature, perhaps one of the reasons is my childhood. since i was a child, nobody would listen to me, so i have to encourage myself, rather than to condemn; nobody would comfort me, so i cried not, nor complain; throughout my childhood i have to be tough proving myself in everything, for nobody was with me; thanks to the relentless attacks from my own family, i had to earn respect by my hands and will. it formed my blood and bones. </p>
<p>To me, technique isn’t the most important, neither is muscle or physical conditions, but mind, because mind could change your muscle, physical conditions, and indeed techniques. if you have no background like me, you have no formula, tips, physical conditionings, muscles — nothing — from daddy or master to look up, then you have to create your own space by your will. you need you have to be smarter, harder, tougher, more optimistic than anyone else. you also need to be more THANKSGIVING for everyone who’s willing to help you, love you, or even hurt you, for all that builds you up no matter what once you survive. </p>
<p>(Also don’t dwell in the past, no matter it was sweet or bitter. no one cares. and even if someone cares, you don’t need to care. lol. past is past. you only focus on your present moment. most people on earth live in the past or in the future or both, and have emotions upon their scenario. that’s not living imo, but i can’t judge; your decision. )</p>
<p>Optimistic in difficult time isn’t easy. removing all the emotions and egos is hard, too. but we can try our best focusing on those we can control, as i always said. i don’t care the results so-called win-or-lose: results are just integers or logic gates, if you know what i meant. i care only about progressing and actions. be a monk, knocking the bell everyday. don’t quit. </p>

<p>Life is lonely, but long, as people thought that’s crowded, but short. </p>
<p>If Edwin and Rudi lived in another world, they might be isolated, destroyed. In this world, they were invincible, impeccable, strong, with their frost monk or fire mage abilities. Without those abilities, perhaps in a world, they were just a pity, miserable and marred, for, after all, they were lonely by nature. Their loneliness came from their principles. People were not so clean, yet make white lies or cheat everyday, as Rudi and Edwin’s personal principles allow them not. They were different, while the difference from majority, especially major sins, is a curse. A curse that isolates you from others, where people could call upon you, Not Normal, sometimes even Stupid or Unwise. </p>
<p>They were. </p>
<p>Of course, they expected friends and lovers. But the human natures would deviate their friends and lovers. Lies, Hatreds, Infidelity, Betrays, Backstabbing. That’s normal. No normal one can prevent from those sins, yet Rudi and Edwin can’t even join the natural sins that grant the two blessing of “normal”, and that curse the two into lonely. </p>
<p>Rudi was usually cold. Edwin was usually heated. But they were both lonely.</p>
<p>Everyone in this world knew dragons were deceitful. But how about human kinds? Can they really trust each other? The answer is simple. </p>
<p>Dreams can divide into reflected or stored. Reflected dreams were triggered by stems, events, feelings, such as a radon pain feeling in the past that you forgot what actually it was. They were not preventable, nor intend-able.  Stored dreams were generated by desires, daydreams, aspirations, such as a specific pain that you remembered, or made up. </p>
<p>Warlocks or shadow dragons were masters of dreams, especially those who were recognised as “guru of dreams”. They could bring dreams to life. When a dream was brought to life, it could be a dispellable  buff, or indeed, debuff. Dangerous burdens of hallucinations were they, making the victims fall, due to “their own decisions”. Unnoticeable. </p>
<p>Apparently, despite empowerment of their abilities, both Rudi and Edwin were prone to dispellable curses, debuffs. Rudi’s was his love, hope for family. Edwin’s was his fear, unwillingness for being utilised.</p>
<p>They were fair but tough in their opposite ways, one cold, one heated. Yet they shared similar vulnerabilities. They were victims in their past; unfortunately, might also in their futures. </p>
<p>What was waiting for them? Was that danger? Could their abilities protect them? No one ever knew at this moment. The four tortollan bartenders and the druid, along with all other customers if they paid attention around their faces, had no clues of the two: the drunk, sleepy fire mage, and the sorrowful, sweepy frost monk. Time froze. </p>
<p>Now, Rudi relied on protection, yet Edwin relied on aggression. Their blindfolds were obvious. </p>
<p>The elixir of the healing of the two might be “the pride equilibrium”. The mage used to pride-generated energy, having too much pride, whilst the monk used to pride-restraint energy, having too little pride. Should they find the equilibrium in their opposite hearts, they might solve the same problem in opposite directions. But this was just a thought, anticipation. You never know. </p>

          <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="11"><a href="#11" class="headerlink" title="11"></a>11</h1><p>“Sometimes you are really too soft.” Edwin sipped his wine.<br>“Aye, sometimes I really have problem of judgements. ” Rudi quaffed his nip of whisky.<br>“You just can’t face the truth, that somebody sometimes cannot be saved. You thought you can forgive. How about your own survival? ” Edwin said.””<br>“Aye. “ Rudi.<br>“You thought you can handle that. Sometimes you thought you can heal them. No, you not, but just cost your own life. ”Edwin continued, “You really should have your own family, in lieu of extending your love whimsically. ” Edwin put and concluded.<br>“O why are you always so wise. ” Rudi.<br>“For I burn and cleanse. ” as Edwin joked, he continued “You really need. You have to. ”<br>“Mayhaps.” Rudi quaffed another nip of whisky. </p>
<p>Here is the bar under water, supported by magic of torsollans. The owners were Leonardo, Donatello, Michelingelo, and Raphael. They were ninjas before they retired and owned this bar. They were all good bartenders, though both Rudi and Edwin didn’t bought any cocktails. O, maybe Rudi’s scotch could be regarded as a “blended cocktail before distillery”? </p>
<p>They drank cup after cup, bottle after bottle, until the sunrise in the other day. </p>
<p>“Look at that. You are drunk. ” Rudi put.<br>“No I didn’t! “ Edwin said.<br>“Hah ha. Look at you. ” Rudi.<br>“No no, I don’t. Buddy. ” as Edwin said, he snored, happened put his left hand his finger hand in front of his mouth, breathed a fire.<br>“Woh woh woh. Hey! Gentlemen! ” Raphael said.<br>“Edwin, don’t burn our small piece of ma and pa, ok? ” Leonardo added.<br>Then Leonardo, Donatello, Michelingelo, Raphael, Rudi and Edwin all laughed. </p>
<p>“You know your problem? “ Edwin continued, “your grandpa. Your code of love, care and forgive. But our world is not that clean, but filthy. So you need continuously lie to yourself. You love even your enemies when they want to hurt you. You can read the airs, but you let others cheat you, for you lie to yourself and justify their evildoings. “<br>“You are talking about subconsciousness. “ Rudi said.<br>“And I won’t let them control, bother, hurt and burden me, if I were you. “ Edwin continued, “I would cleanse my problems with flames. I save myself before saving others. Let alone someone you cannot save due to their own decisions. “ </p>
<p>“So what’s your problem, Edwin?” said Donatello.<br>“We want to find someone. ” said Edwin.<br>“You who? ” said Donatello.<br>“Sadly, we don’t know. ” Edwin.<br>“Hmm. Interesting. ” Donatello.<br>“A dragon claimed an identity unto Edwin, and deceived an important possession. Unto same location, where he claimed to be a king, we found him not. They’re gone, both our thing and this guy. ” Rudi.<br>“Dragons? They are usually deceitful. Everybody knows, especially when they thought cheating on human kinds no big deal. “ Donatello.<br>“And we got to find our thing. ” Rudi.<br>“What kind of thing? “ Donatello.<br>“A shoulderguard. ”Rudi. </p>
<p>Then Donatello ruminated. said Wiping the cup, Michelingelo added, “usually, when a dragon got a thing from you, you can’t trace it back. ”. Leonardo then said, “In fact, Raphael also lost a thing from dragons. For decades, you had found it til we faced the reality. ”</p>
<p>Michelingelo said, “man, they are socerers, if not powerful then them. They had skins and armours. They casted magic, yet required no casting time, unlike human-kind mages. You could kill them, but well, they are tough guys. ”</p>
<p>Donatello said, “their invasions were thru-o history of human kind. The origin of eastern new year was also due to them. You know, they were no folklores. They were true stories. Nians killed and ate children for snacks. Human kinds don’t eat young monkeys for snacks, for monkeys are smart and have emotions. But for dragons, they can’t care less. Eat eat eat. Cheat cheat cheat. They thought everything belongs to them. ”</p>
<p>Rudi said, “my friend can cast spells instantly, and he wears artefact armours. I guard him, as he fires, all of dragons burn. “<br>Leonardo said, “sounds like a plan. Hah. “</p>
<p>Rudi then approached to a girl, saying, “your eyes are not jewellery, are they? “<br>The girl laughed, answered, “well. This line is not impressive. “<br>“This is not a line, but an objective observation. “ Rudi.<br>“Whoa? Are you kidding me? “ said the girl.<br>“Rudi. “ said Rudi.<br>“Seraphine. “ said the girl.<br>“Good name but long, like your hairs. “ said Rudi.<br>“What brings you here? “ said Seraphine.<br>“Wind. “ Rudi nodded, “cold wind in eternal ice. “<br>“Ah… “ Seraphine.<br>“Not yet in Seraphine’s eyes. “ Rudi put.<br>“O… “<br>“So what do you drink, tonight? “ Rudi.<br>“Burning Insects juice, I guess? “ Seraphine.<br>“That’s sweet, right, Leonardo? Not a pro in cocktails, let alone your profound naming system. “ yelled Rudi.<br>“Definitely. Why don’t you try even one in our bar. You are boring, ordering the same whisky all the time. “ Leonardo.<br>“No. I won’t. “ yelled Rudi, then he told unto Seraphine in his usual low, cold voice, “alright. I just want to say your eyes are petty. Nice to see them. “<br>“Well. Thank you. “ Seraphine put, eyeing on Rudi continuously.</p>
<p>Rudi got back seat. Edwin said, “are you kidding me? What are you doing. “<br>“That’s enough. I just want to say thanks, for her eyes brighten my night. “ replied Rudi.<br>“Come on! “ said Edwin, “ she’s interested in you! “<br>“No she doesn’t. And whatever. “ said Rudi. Then they talked about all kind of things, such as work, missions, memories. Also they talked to the owners of the bar. They tortollans were pretty old. </p>
<p>Later, the girl approached him, “you are kind of funny. What you do? “<br>“We are finding a dragon, or a group of dragons. “ said Rudi, “yet we still did nothing, til we have clues. “</p>
<p>“What for? They are rogues. “ she said.<br>“Our item was deceived, “ said Rudi.<br>“No change for you to take back. “<br>“Did you hear any dragons, occasionally? “<br>“I am not sure. “<br>“Are you a resident here? “<br>“Yes, I live here since I was born. “<br>“How old are you? “<br>“25. “<br>“15 years younger than I. “<br>“Really. You look young. “<br>“Don’t bald, moustache look old? “<br>“No but look cold. Like you said, you were brought by cold winds. “<br>“Well but thou art starting melting me. “<br>“Actually I am a Druid. “<br>“So you know instinct. “<br>“A bit. “<br>“You prefer instinct or fate? “<br>“Why? “<br>“I meditate every night for our thing. “<br>“Oh come on. What so important? And you have no chance. “<br>“Summon your flame blade. “<br>“What?! “<br>“Summon. Try me. “ Rudi said.<br>Then the girl smiled, beamed, as if been flirted. She hesitated a second, “alright. “ then she was summoning the fire element, a very important spell in so-called equilibrium arts, before structuring any so-called the wraths of nature. Then she formed the element into a flame blade unto her beautiful brown meticulously amber-like right hand.<br>“Pretty… “ said Rudi.<br>Then the girl stroke him with the blade, smiling. That’s a big but artless blow, for she predicted Rudi to dodge, while he didn’t. The blade cut thru the body. “Oh… sorry. “ she was shocked, but right in another second, she was shocked even worse. Her blade was frozen for some reason. What? Impossible.<br>“…Much. “ said Rudi, “I like your hand. “ Rudi continued to tease the girl, “jewellery eyes, amber-like hand… anything else beautiful? “<br>“How can it be… flame blade is one of the most destructive and stable weapon in my wrath of nature. Let alone it cannot be dispelled. “ said the girl, trembling.<br>“Now, may we have a chance, “ Rudi paused, “… against dragons? “ said Rudi. The girl was stunned, also stunning, so he got the girl with one big step closer. He stopped, gently, yet firmly, kissing her forehead, as he couldn’t help himself. He continued, coldly and lowly, “You smell good. “<br>He paused again, “so, did you really not hear anything related to dragons? “<br>“Actually, I… “ the girl nervously stammered, “acknowledged a clan of dragons here. Not precisely, I meant. Wait… Let me think. “<br>Idled Rudi, smiling.<br>Then she continued, “you are really strange. “<br>With beam wore, Rudi coked a bit, “You are strange, too. ”</p>
<p>Suddenly, didn’t know why, Rudi recalled, or even missed, his ex-wife. They were together for more than 8 years. Before she left her, she said, Have been unhappy for many years with you the wrong guy, while Rudi didn’t know any single sign. After she left him for 3 months, she said unto him, I have been seeing someone else now, good bye Rudi, focus on yourself. Yet how could Rudi focus on his hollow self? </p>
<p>He hoped her everything fine, yet still felt painful, for he loved her so much, so deep, more than himself. She commented their relationship as “Wicked Love”, and he didn’t know why. He tried his best to complement her, comfort her, even in arguments. But it turned out, those were just perfunctory communications in her sights and ears. </p>
<p>Maybe, to her, he is just someone who didn’t know the art of words, and no reason for this to work out. Let alone she threatened him occasionally, and sued him. Still, full of sweet memory were in his minds. To Rudi, sourness cannot bury sweeties. Apparently, her ex-partner had different opinion. After all, he knew she forgot him as she said, yet he still occasionally recalled her, or missed her, like this moment. </p>
<p>“Hey, are you okay? ” said Seraphine.<br>“I don’t know. “ said Rudi. </p>

          <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="Chapter-X"><a href="#Chapter-X" class="headerlink" title="Chapter X"></a>Chapter X</h1><p>It was a huge waterfall. Rudi passed first, watching. He seemed to see dragons, but he wasn’t sure. </p>
<p>Dragons were powerful animals, but still animals. Their power came from each their special talents when they decided their “path” or alignment. For example, shadow dragons knew how to hide themselves and how to manipulate minds. That was the profession as Warlock came from. Human kinds learnt from dragons, a lot. But in turn, dragons regarded human kinds sort of “pettable” animals. Usually they used human kinds for their own profits. Indeed, human kinds also learnt and improved their sinful tricks from dragons. </p>
<p>So Rudi wasn’t sure whether there was a dragon, due to, if any, shadow tricks from shadow dragons. He could read the airs, so he started to predict: “20%”<br>“50%”<br>“90%”<br>As he got closer and closer, he assured more and more.<br>“What the hack are you doing? “ Edwin yelled abruptly.<br>“Shh, they were near. “<br>“Who? “<br>“Some dragons. I am sure now. “ Rudi.<br>“Don’t fear. I am blood-oathed. “ </p>
<p>As Edwin concluded as such, Rudi couldn’t explain, for it’s dangerous to be distracted now. Dragons, despite also a specie of mortal animals, were unpredictably powerful. </p>
<p>“Do you know how close you came to getting yourself shot? “ a dark, low-pitch, loud voice came thru the airs until it hit Rudi’s ears. Aye, 100% there were dragon, or dragons. </p>
<p>Rudi started to mediate, finding more than one dragon near. 1, 2, 3…, oh, maybe 10. </p>
<p>“I did once I saw your gun or magic at my face… Joking, no offence. “ Rudi replied in the same low-pitch, coldly. </p>
<p>“How dare you?! “ dragons roared.<br>“Here is a misunderstood. My apologies, Brothers. I am actually blood-oathed with your king. “ Edwin said shortly, eloquently.<br>“What the hell blood are you mentioning? Mortal in armour. And which king do you suggest? Do you know our society? Burger King? “ one dragon said.<br>Edwin paled. He didn’t expect that.<br>“Why don’t you guys get away from us before my friend grills you into crispy yummy dragon chips? “ Rudi said, again, coldly and confidently. Dragons never saw such rudeness. Perhaps that’s why Rudi was named for.<br>“Well. Well. Well. Interesting. But you are right. We decide to either kill you both, or take away all the possessions of you both. What is your call? “ one dragon said.<br>“Do you see any gear in me? Big guy, oh, big guys. “<br>“You never know. We can see thru your dead bodies if you don’t mind. What’s your call? “ Another dragon added.<br>“I hope no trouble. Why don’t you just go away now? ” Rudi.<br>“I am afraid not. ” Dragon replied.<br>“Please go away and make peace. ” Rudi.<br>“You fear? ” Dragon.<br>“You feel that way? ” Rudi.<br>“No…. that’s strange. ” Just as a dragon answered as such, another two dragons threw shadow bolts, and two dragons shadow danced into the back of Rudi, backstabbing with their shadow claws.<br>Rudi knew that, freezing the bolts crossing the zone radius of 5 m around him, and dodging the two stabbings.<br>“Art ye serious? Lads? ” Just as Rudi said, he started the storm of kicks and fists. The shadow bolts were reflected, and the stabbing dragons got hurt, with one wing broken in one dragon’s body. The shadow bolts flew back unto the shooters, hurting them. Rudi breathed alcohol disorienting the dragons near then, kicking thru the way unto the shooters. He touched his fingers, if not jabbed, into the skins of two dragons, as they seemed poisoned by ice.<br>“Edwin? ” Rudi said.<br>“What have I done… I fear… ”<br>“Don’t fear. Edwin. It happened. We will figure it out later. Now we are in combat. ” Rudi.<br>“I can’t think. “<br>“Then show your anger. ” Rudi.<br>Still idle, Edwin stood with a sorrowful and regretful face, thinking about his Legendary Artefact shoulderguard “blood-oathed and saved”, but responding not. Other dragons jerked some attacks, magic or gun, at Edwin. Rudi froze the attacks for Edwin, and dashed unto Edwin for “catching” the assaults for Edwin with his body.<br>“Who are you… human kind. ” One dragon marvelled at Rudi.<br>“Wake up, Edwin. You are just in self-doubt. Be not! Back to life! ” Rudi whispered, but Edwin could hear that. As Rudi got hit, or caught the assaults with his body, he buffeted on the ground vigorously with his left palm, if not violently. The ground cracked, with some into ice flakes.<br>“This guy is crazy. ” One dragon added.<br>“What you did? ” One dragon asked.<br>“I programmed, debugging,. You are the bugs. Now you can still leave, if you don’t want to get hurt. “ Rudi said.<br>“Alright. We will no troubles here … ” one injured dragon said, and the other hurt ones agreed.<br> Then Rudi stopped all the things, firmly. As he thought there’s no trouble anymore, some dragon blew him in the back from shadow dancing.<br>Despite enduring those attacks, Rudi was regretful in hurt feeling, for he trusted the words of deceits, again, in fact, even after knowing they can’t be trusted.<br>“My lesson is pride issue. Your lesson is forgiveness issue. ” Edwin commented, joked. “Yeah, I am back to life. ” Then he started to scorch the dragons near Rudi and himself, splashing the flames unto the other dragons. He raised his mace later, “Burn,” as he said, all the dragon ignited. Then Rudi breathed frost alcohols again unto them, as their skins burnt to crispy.<br>“Ahh… no… ”<br>“Now we trust you not. ” As Edwin said, he channeled flames again, then summoning three small size meteorites. As they landed, dragon got hurt faintly. “But this time, I slow my cook. ” He then summon a small “charcoal-like” flame under each dragon’s body, whether live or not, cooking. Fire burning sounds everywhere.<br>“Origin or extra crispy? Mon Ami? ” Edwin asked, joking.<br>“In this situation, Mr. chef, I have only one option. ” Rudi replied. </p>

<p>“Torture him. Torture him. ”</p>
<p>“He is evil and mean. I can tell by his appearance. Let’s prevent it before it even exists. ”</p>
<p>“He got problems. ”</p>
<p>“He is so annoying. ”</p>
<p>“He is my burden. ”</p>
<p>People yelled, around the cage, or simply a tiny hutch, where Rudi “lived” in. He was chained by several shackles and jesses. He wore a piece of cloth, if not nothing. He was damp, for people occasionally spited on him, and full of blood around the body, for people hurt him for fun, by any interesting weapons punishment instruments. Conventional people’s youth time is usually happy hours, but his isn’t, apparently, if not worse than torture. </p>
<p>“He deserves it. ”</p>
<p>“He is worst person I ever met. ”</p>
<p>“He might be clever, but he uses in wrong way. ”</p>
<p>“But what did he properly do wrong? ”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. “</p>
<p>“I don’t know either. But because he is a looser, it’s obviously his fault. ”</p>
<p>“Oh good point! “</p>
<p>“So. We don’t know the facts but who cares? ”</p>
<p>“Yeah. He deserves it. ”</p>
<p>“That’s not close enough. “</p>
<p>His arm and leg were obvious crippled, festered, and you don’t want to know why and how. </p>
<p>“Let him calm himself. ”</p>
<p>“He is so prideful. ”</p>
<p>“I hate his eyes. ”</p>
<p>“Something wrong in his head. ”</p>
<p>“He is so negative. ”</p>
<p>“So negative! “</p>
<p>“Negative! ”</p>
<p>All negativisms and sarcasms around him, ironically, people around him said Rudi is negative. He is calm and positive, yet called negative, by somebody spitting, hating, attacking, cursing, and torturing. </p>
<p>“Burn him in hell. ”</p>
<p>“Burn!”</p>
<p>“We are already treating you pretty good, Rudi. You deserves it. ”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you don’t need face and dignity. You should be put to death. ”</p>
<p>“Yeah, so now you are already very lucky. You should thank! ”</p>
<p>“We are teaching you! “</p>
<p>So people also burnt him with fire or red-hot iron. When they did, Rudi could only calm him down, freezing the wounds, hurts, pains, injuries in his imagination. Blessed, he learnt great deals upon the tortures and punishments from his inner power of frost. He was too focus on his inner power, as to avoid being really hurt by those people around him. In addition, aye, ironically he really thanked and forgave those around him who tortured and taught him, somehow?! He didn’t know he was becoming a frost monk, and his flesh and bones were also turning profoundly —— Although no one cares.</p>
<p>He fainted. </p>
<hr>
<p>In his dream, he remembered several dialogues with his closest fellows. </p>
<p>They said things like this: </p>
<p>“I am the one who concerns about you the most. “</p>
<p>“Thank you. And I respect that. “ Rudi replied. </p>
<p>“They despise you but I love you the most. “</p>
<p>“Ok. I love you too. But I don’t care what others said. No matter what happened, I forgive them. “ Rudi replied. </p>
<p>“No, You should hate them. You should have judgement. “</p>
<p>“I feel for you and it’s all her fault. I hate her for your past, you hate her, don’t you? “</p>
<p>“I don’t hate anyone. I forgave her. “ Rudi. </p>
<p>“Then you are fool. You don’t know what happened. “</p>
<p>“I knew what happened and I forgave her. But thank you. “ Rudi. </p>
<p>Despite this, all those guys told bad things behind Rudi’s back, ironically. He was the only one said only positive things, yet everybody backstabbed him. </p>
<p>Or, </p>
<p>“He is evil and mean. “</p>
<p>“How do you know. “ Rudi.</p>
<p>“I have judgement and you are dumb but don’t have judgement and nor do you know a thing. You were cheated, hoaxed, misled. I am teaching you. But you keep standing with him but not with me. You spoke more already, which is good, but not close enough. What is your judgement? “</p>
<p>“My judgement is that you and he should get alone with each other, trusting each other. Don’t think that way, despite its hardness. Don’t follow the bad feelings but the good faiths! Please. “ Rudi. </p>
<p>“You don’t know things. It’s impossible. I am different from him. He is mean, fake. “</p>
<p>“You are similar, for you both have good hearts, helping others. Just stop thinking that way. Love and care should be the only thing important. “ Rudi. </p>
<p>“Ok. Stop. “</p>
<p>Similar dialogues happened in another end in the pair. And between each different pair, similarities arose, too. </p>
<p>Ironically also, some of those pairs called Rudi the backstabber who alienates people?! “ How could they? But I can only forgive them… “ Rudi didn’t really understand that, for Rudi knew not the complexity of human natures. Sounds like he also lacks human natures. This also contributed his special ability: Reading The Airs, for he knew the natures in his own exclusive way, for lacking human natures also granted him peace of mind objectively to know the airs, and to “find the centre”. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, even though Rudi kept silent in other scenario, which he usually did, he got trouble, even more severely than said as such. Fortunately, this Reading The Air ability became his combat martial arts. </p>
<p>Like in our world, Jesus was the one under crucifixion, spits, for He hath no faults. </p>
<p>Of course Rudi is not Jesus, let alone presence in our world. He was a monk in his world. Maybe he was just extremely unwise, naïve, stupid brat. He doesn’t know. Only God knows. </p>

<p>“Fuck that’s pretty high. I will fall. ”</p>
<p>“No. We won’t. And you are awesome. ”</p>
<p>“Man. Don’t you know how heavy my armour is??“</p>
<p>“Aye I knew.”</p>
<p>“And don’t you see how shabby this drawbridge is? ”</p>
<p>“Even if we fall, we won’t die. “</p>
<p>“But I hate that! Man! “ Edwin concluded. </p>
<p>Their case, as expected, was a winning one. But Edwin didn’t burn them as he thought, for burning lawyers doesn’t change anything, to his prudence. He wanted something bigger.</p>
<p>He was an paid public inquisitor in his home town on the south. That job was nice and liberal in terms of timetables, so he could do whatever he wanted, planning his own projects and deadlines. If not, he would just quit within a second, for he concerns about freedom the most. Let alone social activities. Apart from some female agents - categorised as cute girls, or so-called the fuckable - he didn’t want to engage in any kind of meetups, dinners, or parties. Aye, all he wanted to do at that time, after calling a day, was getting away from any work or colleagues. He went museum and shopping sometimes, for he loved cooking and artworks, otherwise, he just went home. </p>
<p>Now their newest project was totally striking this thirsty, or any other addiction, supply chains.</p>
<p>“Well. By the way, what was your old pauldron? didn’t see that. ”</p>
<p>“Oh. I got a good deal. Those dragons gonna fear me, for I had blood oath with that dragon clan. ”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? ”</p>
<p>“You don’t understand. You will see that. “</p>
<p>“Just so you knew, even your former pauldron was a artefact legendary armour. Be careful. Human kinds are selfish, let alone dragons. ”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I knew what I am doing. “</p>
<p>“Sometimes you don’t, until you learn the lesson later, especially when you want something just too badly. ”</p>
<p>“Oh man! They really gave what I wanted, let alone I got this special offer. Not everyone like me can sign a contract with dragon, let alone a Blood Oath with them! “</p>
<p>“Well, Blood Oath…” For Rudi can read the airs, he knew something was wrong, but he loves Edwin so much, hurting his feelings not, thereby keeping silent at this moment after their discussion on the drawbridge. But he was going to figure out what happened, for to his understanding, blood is blood, regardless of any form or source or race. Dragon’s Blood wasn’t any more special. Maybe he was wrong, but he gonna analyse, eviscerate any conspiracy. </p>
<p>“I can’t bear that anymore!” Edwin said, burn a tree, and dashed-in-flames, from the drawbridge.</p>
<p>“That was a training. But anyway. ” Rudi reacted. </p>
<p>“You know what? I really like that girl. Her orgasm was real, I could feel it, man, she nearly bit me with her nails when orgasm! And I loved it when he did that. “</p>
<p>“Aye”</p>
<p>“But her bad breath… man, was unbearable, while I didn’t want to hurt her. I indirectly notified her, that’s what I did, but she… she still thought reluctance. “</p>
<p>“That’s her mind. “</p>
<p>“But I felt bad. I want perfection! “</p>
<p>“I understand. But again, it’s just her mind. Everyone has his her individual mind. “</p>
<p>“But she should listen to me, or at least it’s my responsibility. “</p>
<p>“Nay. Not your responsibility. You had done your best. “</p>
<p>“I don’t care. I care. “</p>
<p>“Well. Don’t burden the heart, for the heart is the strongest muscle, the last hope. “ Rudi uttered. </p>
<hr>
<p>“Give us the money or lay down. You two are surrounded. I will make it quick. “</p>
<p>“Other idiots. “ Edwin started his anger. </p>
<p>“Don’t do that. I am in charge. “ As Rudi said, he dashed upon those guys in lightening speed, and he breathed strong frost alcohol. As such, he frozen and drunk those rogues, who thought they could make them hard time and block their way. </p>
<p>“That’s not right. Rudi. Even they cannot offend us, they could always offend others. They are evil, they can’t change. They must be cleansed. For in this world, killing is legal, they can always get away from any punishment! And our world has no death penalty. Trust me, they’d better just burn and die. “ then Edwin raised his ring hand, fasten into fist, and opened his palm. As such, at the same time, all the bodies of those frozen and drunk rogues blasted into charred crispy meats, flying everywhere, except for their complete heads. “In memory of their sins, I left their heads complete. “ then he hanged their heads onto the tree with ropes, indeed, made by his force magic. </p>
<p>“Well okay. Sometimes this is brutally needed, despite unwanted. “ Rudi commented shortly after this hazard. Before they left, Edwin charred the ground, burning “Death to all evildoers who sin, and who think they can get away from the ending like this. “ another spectacular artworks from Edwin. </p>

Edwin started playing his plates. He lifted one plate in right shouder up with his magic Force. Under the plate, he wore a shirt, only lightly covering his tattoos on the skins. In fact, each plate had each tattoo as ruin on the skin. That’s why he could take off and arm his plates so swiftly. His armor isn’t nessesary powered gear, but it is robust, polished, enhanced by his power. When he took the armor off, the armor became a cube. In this world, there wasn’t so much thing to do with gears, for every material is just material. Power comes from the user, spirits and skills. He wore them because he loves the appearance. So frequently he switched his “suits” if the armor wasn’t a right fit. Edwin’s newsest armor is shined with golden colour. </p>
<p>“He took so long time. Is he in trouble? “ He worried as he thought. “But, man, he’s nearly invincible regarding damages… I doubt anyone can hurt him. “</p>
<p>“This monk a ‘tank’, a unlimited container. “</p>
<p>“But there is no reason to take that long. “</p>
<p>He really wanted to come in the Zone then help, but he couldn’t, for this was a great risk. Anyone can strike him from behind. And he has no eyesights inside the Zone. No eyesights no damage. There wasn’t a sign for him to even just light a candle with his endless magicforce, for the darkness was controlled by warlock’s magic, but not due to nature. Despite wearing the plates, strike from behind could be deadly for the big “cannon” Edwin. After all, though a cannon is strong enough destroying any target, it is not a tank which endures. Until then, he knew nothing inside the Zone. He cannot read the airs. So he kept waiting for right moment. The plan was for Rudi to turn off the switch of the Zone, such that he could see. </p>
<p>Now he was starting reading the tome on his waistbelt. That was gold and quartz texture -not only embedded- on the cover. It was a accessory, but more than a decoration. Like paladin and priest who chain a holy Bible on the waistbelt, he wore it, more elegantly and sumptuously. But this is not a holy bible. </p>
<p>“The girl was sensitive. When I hug her, she got wet, like a swamp in desert. And I kissed her like rains in oasis. Her nipples were nice, soft and pinkish red, hardened as I landed my tongue onto it, where I can lick for all night. They were all sensitive and cute. My caress is in every inch of her silky milky skin. “</p>
<p>He read what he narrated in the past with flatiron magic. No actual “pages” in his tome. All the written characters on page were all inked as such. Despite all magic, a layperson without knowledge of magic could also easily flip over “page” by page. He didn’t name the name of the tome. But you can call it diary of love and romance, although, to him, indeed it could be more important than Holy Bible. As he said, Cute girls are my energy, And you know nothing about my energy. The F&amp;F- his fire and force. </p>
<p>Already for an hour been waiting, “even if he died, I need carry his body. No reason for waiting even longer. “ he warmed up his blood a bit with the magic, and lit his ring on his right hand as his magical lamp. The force by him lifted his feet a bit onto the air, accelerating. He “walked” toward the corner, near and near. At certain point, however, the kindle on the ring couldn’t be seen, as if all the photons were absorbed by multiple black bodies. He feareth the darkness, for he anticipated the risk. They might all die. </p>
<p>“Shit. But I have to come thru the fear.” The environment put irrefutable fear, stress, and pressure on any creature getting near. The nearer, the more intense, that apparently no one can bear, for this is the intuition of creatures, whether living kinds or not, let alone human kinds. Warlocks are experts for manipulations upon intuitions. Edwin was resisting this intuition by his best. </p>
<p>He recalled many years ago, when they engaged with a army of human kinds. Right before the fight, the monk told him about the sorrowful stories: The monk was 7 years younger than he. His family was destroyed. His ex-wife sued him. He was tortured in a cage, where every decent man -including his own family leftovers- participated in the cruel ritual. They burnt every inch of the festered skins on the monk - if they were still skins. They smashed bones of the monk. They shot stimulants, keeping the monk alive and sensitive for the endless torments. But the monk tried his best in meditation, numb. </p>
<p>So during that fight, the mage was in great danger when he was rooted in a snare as magic missiles channeled at him. He couldn’t dash with his magic force, let alone physical movements. He thought he was dying in seconds. But not until being bombed like a beehive, the monk fly kicked in. His kick seemed to slow and freeze the missiles a bit. Then, strangely, he drifted around the mage, blocking and catching all the missiles with his flesh, his back. The skins burnt in lights at once, but the explosions soon enervated, frozen and cool. Aye, the monk caught all the missiles with his flesh and bones… shielded with his skins, but with nothing else.</p>
<p>“You really are a monk… “ Edwin said, “more than that, you are a monk-ster. “</p>
<p>The monk was a watchman still, reading around any potential risk and hazard, so silent, without his usual joking back. </p>
<p>“Do you hear me? Man. But you were really slow. Why you didn’t just kick that guy on his head knocking him out cold! Man. “ </p>
<p>“I can’t deal that kind of burst damage. “ Rudi said. </p>
<p>“Now we are still trapped here. We must die and loose. I hate loosing, but I can’t figure out a way. I am fire mage, and they can resist most of my arts, let alone their damages are so fearful. I would just be bombed like a beehive, laying down like a waste. And after I die, they can just gather their armies against you. You will die soon. “</p>
<p>“You might be right. But don’t think like that. We can prevail. We can win. “</p>
<p>“Then show me how. This is so frustrated. They have all kinds of professions. I can’t do anything. “</p>
<p>“Remember, you are a mage in plates. And you structure, evoke fires with your wrath and emotions. They can’t stop you. “</p>
<p>“But this is not my fighting style at this moment. I want to win elegantly. “</p>
<p>“I knew. And in fact you already are. Just believe. Now, I will use my Chi Walls again, you cumulate your emotions upon the two opposite ends, until you can fully show them your wrath. “</p>
<p>“I can’t. This wastes my time! They can interfere our plan! “</p>
<p>“We are in charge, winning. Let alone no one can practically interfere your casting… your fires come from your emotions but not your concentrations, as you said. They have no chance against us. “</p>
<p>“Only if everything is right! Which is not! “</p>
<p>“Ok. Don’t worry. Now I am doing it. “ Rudi said coldly, starting the meditation sitting. </p>
<p>The wounds the blood started to solidify as the monk meditated. Then some leftovers of missiles flew out radiatively. During the time, green Chi gathered swirls, until they became ice cones-then ice walls. The two ends were identical. </p>
<p>Now the fire blazed in the mage’s eyes, as his fingers were heating. He raised his mace, roaring, there was a dragon’s head formed by flames, breathing, as many fireballs landed onto one end of the two ice walls. As a fireball hit one end, it bounced into the other end of the walls, reflecting continuously. There were too many, so as to turn out being a stream of lava between two ends. </p>
<p>“This is just a waste of time. And I am now angrier and angrier! “ Edwin complained, for he knew the enemies were too many, and they were no laypeople. They were professional soldiers and fighters. They knew how to manipulate and control, gearing good weapons, dealing good damages. They could counter our defence, as they also were clever, with strategies and tactics in minds. We should just try to negotiate our best bets in lieu of fighting for nothing, shit.  The more he thought, the angrier he was. He just wanted to burn, burning this shitty situation.</p>
<p>“Later they would slow me with their lights and curses, before the assassins would target on you. They want to cut loose your head, with their daggers in lightening speed, after the warriors would dash you to knock your head with their shield to disorienting you. Now my frozen Chi is protecting your neck. Don’t dodge. Again, don’t dodge! And don’t fire dash. Please. Just believe in your wraths. All you have to do is to melt the ground in flames with your cumulated wraths. Let them know who is their daddy. “</p>
<p>“Then I only have one shot. This doesn’t make sense. Anyone survives, I die. Then you will die, too. “</p>
<p>“Only if some members would try to kill me. Which they had tried and failed. They won’t try again, for they know they cannot cut thru my skins, let alone my bones. “</p>
<p>“And the gunners and mages will still be alive, shooting us. Then I will die. “</p>
<p>“I will absorb any damage. It’s painful, but after all, no significant damages for me. And I am fast, sure your safety. “ </p>
<p>“In theory. Only in your theory. What if we fail, we all die. “</p>
<p>“No worry. Now. “ Rudi yelled with his deep cold voice, praying it works. Even he never knew. Focus on positive things is the only thing he can do, for his life was a great sorrow. That’s how he survives. </p>
<p>Then Rudi faked as if he is paralysing the shooters. The enemies are experts of combats, so they knew Rudi has no damage. They thought the monk and wizard were just impatient and agitated. They thought their chances came. </p>
<p>Then the fighters dash onto the fire wizard Edwin, along with the shadow dances of assassins unto his back. Cut off the head, kill it, and win. </p>
<p>The other members slowed Rudi with greasing snares, so that the main damage dealers can kill Edwin with their bursts. </p>
<p>Then Edwin roared, “You fool mortals. “ bending over, hitting the ground with his mace of arcanite. “Burn! In my wrath and anger. “</p>
<p>The assassins showed up, spinning their body each, except one squatting in the front lower body of Edwin, as two fighters dashed on left, right side of Edwin. Edwin was focus, for he was angry. </p>
<p>When the daggers swung near the neck of the wizard, they were slowed by the frost Chi, along with the spiralling assassins’ hands gripping them. No assaults were successful just yet, at least during this wave of hits. </p>
<p>The man squatted in front of the wizard thought he got the good timing for a deadly strike, but he was wrong, as he reverse slashed with his long dagger from the bottom, or short sword, he just felt pain on his right hand…, which blew away. Burnt, exploded, withered, charred. “Ahh…” he screamed.</p>
<p>“My crotch is dangerous. Fool. “ he thought, but never said, for he was focusing on his deadly thermodynamics spells. </p>
<p>In this world, there are three laws in the thermodynamics: First law is the law of conservation, energy in each system is isolated, which means energy’s amounts are constant during a process. And the Second law is the law of irreversibility of natural process, which, once any process done, means entropy should only increase. And the Third law, suggesting the release of cumulated energy unto a state called residual entropy, is the backbone of all process. Edwin’s magic depends solely on the law of thermodynamics. So some of his abilities accumulating his wraths, which is not revertible process, and releasing wraths brings him back to his inner state into residual entropy times an unknown value, as such motions of his releasing wraths is the major source of damages he dealt. That’s why the tactics of monk and wizard could work, for the wraths generated are not reversible, until the wizard releases all of them, incinerating all the place into hell of flames. Let alone the two ends of walls accumulated the wraths and leftover heatings in much acceleration.</p>
<p>“Reduce.. To Aaaaaash. “ as he said, all the airs became a combustion of superheat. The water gasses were too high in temperature, as if there were fogs of flames, burning every each of anything. He visualised his anger into reality, if it’s not reality more than true, and cruel. Now even metals of weapon and gears were burning, as they were melting - all at once, actually, everything was incinerated, reducing to the ashes. </p>
<p>It was a total silence. Heating, no bodies, but all white colour powders. You don’t want to know what the powders were. Cremated, nothing left. </p>
<p>Fast, no concentration required. He casted this total destruction out under gang bangs. They could not interfere him by any chance. This is the rage wizard Edwin. </p>
<p>But now he still in his hesitation was sneaking, though he knew he should overcome the fears in heart. </p>
<p>“Maybe I just focus on cumulating wraths, so I don’t fear. “ good idea, he raised his ring hand, shooting fireballs in random directions. No hitting, no wraths, but at least preventing feeling of fears. </p>
<p>He sought to pull something with his Force. But in vein did he pull anything. This place is like a void. How did Rudi get in so fast? Or just it had different spaces? He didn’t know. He didn’t want to dwell in the feeling about it, for this just burdened him. He knew he need to deviate his unpleasant feelings. </p>
<p>So he kept pulling things, or at least air, and fingering fireballs on no targets. The space was so dark, that even fireballs couldn’t light the environment. But he finally found a way of marching: by random fireballs and force pulling he might sense direction, despite so eyesights. </p>
<p>He kept marching on his steps. Interestingly, he got the feelings of wraths energy. Aye, he hit something, or somebody, despite in total darkness. </p>
<p>Finally he saw a slight light upon his head. He knew this is the way. He used his force to pull himself onto the wall, or anything, crawling in the dark, drifting upward. </p>
<p>Now a burning shadow ghost showed up suddenly, behind his back. He knew that, fingering it, a flame fist in his image came out, devouring the already burning shadow ghost, before he kept drifting up with his Force. He looked more like a furious warrior with superpower than anything. </p>
<p>Then he finally saw the frost-injured senior warlock, and the monk in meditation. Sitting? He thought, but suddenly he knew the monk was doing the mind game against the warlock, for the warlocks are experts of minds, as, in fact, warlocks are too dependent to mind tricks, so sometimes significant defects are along with their practice of minds. Their advantage could be their greatest enemy. That’s also why the monk always said, my peace of mind is my strongest hold. </p>
<p>Then he raised his mace, ejecting a column of flames extending onto the warlock from his mace, burning the airs. As the monk, later, turned the frost Chi around the frost injuries in warlock’s body, into frozen alcohol, the body of warlock became a cage of extremely high pressure and heat. <em>Boom!</em> The body of the warlock bursted just like a blasted bloom. Blood and meats spread everywhere, before they burnt to coal, darkened. The black body parts and burnt-out blood were just another piece of Edwin’s artworks. </p>
<p>“So what postponed you so long? Man. “ Edwin said as if nothing ever happened. </p>
<p>“Hah ha, aye, I be damage dealer not like thou. You killed him in less than one second. “</p>
<p>“I don’t care. We should have more time talking and drinking. They are just trash. “</p>
<p>“Ah, haha, okay. Well, this is the evidence. “</p>
<p>“Who cares the evidence?!”</p>
