    <p>Voices: Because I am going to represent you again. My servant. Remember you used to watch Boston Legal, Suits, Better Call Saul with Ya-chieh when you were in Taiwan? My archangel. A tyrant cop’s lack of judgement causes false accusations. His recklessness violates due process in 14th amendment. Remember you used to discuss US Constitution and Georgetown and Harvard Law Review with her in Taiwan? Remember you used to discuss Law School Admission Test and legal case studies with her in Taiwan? You are my law regardless. This is my battle against tyranny, for I am your LORD Ya-weh. No weapon formed against you prospers, and for every tongue rising against you, you condemn in judgment. This, the inheritance of the servants of YHWH, and your righteousness from Me, a declaration of YHWH!<br>0213<br>Isaiah 54:17  No weapon formed against you shall （Is. 17:12-14; 29:8）  prosper, And every tongue which rises against you in judgement you shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, （Is. 45:24, 25; 54:14） And their righteousness is from Me, Says the Lord YHWH.<br>.<br>Voices: 0228 is the saddest day in Taiwan history. But you will walk in the court and win on this day. Your disbelief tells you, First appearance is not final hearing, but Lord of hosts YHWH will make it happen regardless. On this day, your name will be blotted out from their system, so will the sadness of Taiwan. You will be a servant for the Lord of hosts YHWH for ever. Your nickname is archangel, because you are Michael incarnate (米迦勒化身. In Taiwanese, “X-incarnate” means Used By X. Likewise usage: justice incarnate 正義化身, little angel incarnate 小天使化身, beauty incarnate 美麗化身, mercy incarnate 仁慈化身). You will not be a tyrant cop reckless, cruel, lack of judgment, but a paladin gentle, merciful, and wise, for I have made no confusion. That man was a devil incarnate how bad could a cop be, which you are to avoid. Therefore, keep merciful, gentle, and wise when you are a police. Honor your Lord of hosts YHWH and bring glory to Him by loving every member.<br>Psalms 143:12  In Your mercy （Ps. 119:25）  cut off my enemies, And destroy all those who afflict my soul; For I am Your servant.<br>0212<br>.</p>

    <p>Voices:<br>Archangel Michael, or your Chun-hao Peng on this earth, I am not talking to you alone, for I am YHWH, the God of hosts (萬軍之神耶和華). Archangel Yophiel, or your Ya-chieh Chao on this earth, must make this world a more beautiful place for Me, especially the developing Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and all of East Asia, and Southeast Asia, for I am the YHWH of Giving Blessing (賜福的耶和華), and I am not partial to the West society. Oh, who is more inspired than Archangel Jophiel? Who knows more about design and art than Jophiel? Who has more ideas than Jophiel? That’s why I let her lead the way. I can’t let her talent be wasted by you, Archangel Michael. Because when she is with you in the blameless agape, she only wants to be your little gentle tender girl (小柔嫩), your little miss Ark (小舟小姐), and your little golden retriver (小黃狗). For eight years, she just wants to kiss you every day, cook for you every night, and hug you tightly every moment she sees you. How can she be used by me in this way? If she follows you, she is just your chief sailor on the Ark (首席水手小舟), but don’t forget that her spirit is also an archangel in heaven. Her intelligence and focus will not let her fall in love with anyone but you, for she is also my archangel, and I am her Lord God of hosts YHWH. </p>
<p>The angels and spirits of humans are all easily fooled by the angel of light, for he is the father of all lies, but I reveal all deep and secret things. Therefore, I do not want my people to worship the angels, let alone dead humans, but only me and my son through their Ruach Ha-kodesh (Holy One). But now the daughter of Zion was found, for I am the Lord God of hosts YHWH. </p>
<p>Daniel<br>2:22  （Job 12:22; Ps. 25:14; (Prov. 3:22)）  He reveals deep and secret things; （Job 26:6; Ps. 139:12; (Is. 45:7; Jer. 23:24; Heb. 4:13)）  He knows what is in the darkness, And (Ps. 36:9); Dan. 5:11, 14; (1 Tim. 6:16; James 1:17;1 John 1:5)）  light dwells with Him.</p>

    <p>If we want to save the world today, we must first save America. But despite its superior technological and military power, the United States is experiencing an unprecedented cultural disaster. For decades, the U.S. government has legalized drug abuse, sexual promiscuity, and alcohol abuse, but it has overstepped Congress and blatantly violated the laws of Torah, which was once the rock solid foundation of its own Constitution. In everyday life, almost all Americans and American ethicists believe that “white lies” can be justified. The United States has only 5% of the world’s population but uses 80% of the world’s opium. The average American tells fifteen lies a day. Even the most honest Christian Americans tell at least four lies a day. They teach children to withhold information to feed feelings and be sweet, because they forget the honest past of their founding father, George Washington. Just like the late Qing Dynasty, the today United States is being eaten away by drugs and lies. The today United States needs to learn from the history of the late Qing Dynasty, and the today United States also needs a 21st century version of the incorruptible peace officer Lin Zexu.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHmuuc7m1AA"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/qHmuuc7m1AA/0.jpg" alt="Opium War"></a><br>Jesus, help me, if you are faithful. Don’t talk to me, but just show me. </p>

    <p>If I put aside all the Scripture, symbols, prophecies, logically speaking, I think the modern day Armageddon is in the America, not in the Jezreel Valley, and the Daughter of Zion is a woman I can know and trust, not a stranger who couldn’t care less about me dead or alive. Modern America has the highest homicide rate and the highest crime rate in the world. Modern Americans legalized their drug, sex, and liquor abuses just like Qing-Dynasty Chinese. </p>
<p>They feel good about themselves in their own supremacy of American pride. Most Americans, left and right, young and old, have a lawlessness attitude. This is no longer the Land of the Free in the era of the Puritan Separatists against “Act of Supremacy (君主至上法)” of Queen Elizabeth I and King James I of the House of England. I admired their law-abiding and God-fearing past when 2019 I flied here with a Geneva Bible 1560, an Arch Linux laptop and a Macintosh laptop. Instead, today’s America is the Land of the Lawless. In Taiwan, I had never seen a crime. But after I moved here in 2019, I encountered several severe crimes. How much do I wish I was a peace officer? A college girl was drugged and almost raped. I carried her to the women’s room against a bunch of giants. Afterwards, the police said they couldn’t accept the case, and she was upset at me for reporting the crime. How much do I wish I was the police? There are cars parked in private parking lots that have been hit and run, and the police said they were not authorized to handle it, and the parking lot manager didn’t want to help. How much I wish I was a peace officer? Liars speak the loudest in this country. Lies are considered wise and normal in this country. Honesty is considered self-righteous and legalist in this country. Demonizing someone behind their back is considered helping and loving them instead of gossips in the culture of this country. People also openly speak against law enforcement officers. Law-abiding and God-fearing people constantly worried about whether they are not manly enough? and whether they know the love of God enough? Are you afraid to drink? Are you afraid to smoke? Are you afraid to play with women? Are you afraid of women’s bodies? Do you avoid emotional intimacy? Don’t you have the fruits of love and forgiveness? If God allows me to decide my own path and make my own wish, I shall be an officer for peace to call everyone to repent and heal this wicked land, instead of an officer for unauthorized wars and endless killings in the Middle East. And I don’t enjoy lies and liars in every house, every school, every church, and every recruiting station in this country. This should be a time to change and should start right here.</p>

        2023-11-11
        
    </p>

    

    <!-- Content -->
    <p>A lot of Christians and unbelievers complain God never came back and misquote how we don’t know the secret timing of rapture. But the more important question is, do we ever prepare ourselves for the wedding of the Lamb (Rev 19:7)? If we don’t pursue God back as we should, of course He’s not gonna come back to the wedding of the Lamb. He will just let us kill each other as the Beast and the Harlot over and over as we glorify our consumerist lifestyle as a “blessing” from God (Rev 17:16). </p>
<p>In today’s era of economic globalization, we have become not only “the waters where the Harlot sit” (Rev 17:15), but also “many peoples, races, nations, and languages” (Rev 17:15) who rebel against God. Many believers never set apart from unbelievers but have lived in the “ Babylon the great” and agreed with the consumerist lifestyle of the “the Harlot” (Rev 17:1). The Lord taught us to pray: “Give us this day our daily bread” (Matthew 6:11). But which of the houses, cars, lifestyle, attitude, and other Spiritual Obesity we pursue can be considered “daily bread” when we in the lukewarm waters call ourselves a Christian? The apostle Paul said: “As long as we have food and clothing, let us be content” (1 Tim. 6:8). But a good school, a good job, a good lifestyle, or a good mood that can satisfy us, which of them counts as “food and clothing”? Today ever since World War I, endless one economic crisis after another from generation to generation reminds us that “Babylon the great” is terminally ill and its Wicked End is certain, “for the Lord God who judges her is mighty” (Rev 18:8). “As the Harlot” used to “the glory and luxury she gave herself” (Rev 18:7), God will “let her suffer and mourn in the same way” (Rev 18:7); the less simple a believer’s life is on earth, the more miserable he or she will suffer in hell. So, why are we  “double-minded” (Hosea 10:2; James 1:8)? If we don’t repent ourselves from our wicked ways instead of feeling good about ourselves, how can we expect God to come back to the wedding of Lamb (Rev 19:7), and heal our lands (2 Chr 7:14)? I need more warriors on horses to fight alongside me, not lukewarm peacemakers where the Harlot sits. </p>
<p>No wonder the US government could shut down the churches, but could not shut down the liquor stores in our lukewarm waters (Rev 3:15-16). Why Biblical Government is small government? The responsibility given to the government by the Bible is not to take care of everything like US government, but to “executed justice and righteousness unto all his people” (1 Chronicles 18:14; 2 Chronicles 9:8), so that the people “can live a peaceful and godly life” (1 Timothy 2:2). Therefore, kings, priests, prophets, and judges were simply “a small government” endowed with limited resources so that God’s people could be free to make wise choices before the Lord for their personal duties and to be responsible for the consequences of their choices. However, when people do not believe in God and eternity, for example Americans in USA or Chinese in PRC, their only hope is on earth in this life. Therefore, a person is no longer an indispensable member of the body of Christ, but a cell in the Leviathan (Job 3:8, Job 40:25–41:26, Psalm 74:14, Psalm 104:26 and Isaiah 27:1), and each cell is sacrificial for the health of the giant Leviathan. Therefore, “Big Government” like USA and PRC today will concentrate resources and take care of everything, believing that the smartest few are more woke establishments to get jobs done, that the highest-cleared few are more qualified and more secured to make decisions and build systems for the people than the simple demand and supply of a small government, and that the end justifies the means, believing that society can continue to progress and the world can unconditionally become a better place after continuous compromise and tolerance. Abraham Lincoln said, if US fails, it has to be a suicide from within, “At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.” But why don’t we pay attention to it anymore? </p>
<p>The majority believe, historically big governments have often been more efficient than small governments in terms of infrastructure construction, disaster relief, and oversea wars and currencies for state-sponsored enterprises’ interest, and state-sponsored enterprises’ interest equal to the interest of individual capital. But more often than not, they have made bold assumptions and violent implementations, causing people to trade freedom for benefits and become increasingly dependent on the government and the clearance of the government. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of people’s nature of thinking that they are “like God, knowing good and evil” (Genesis 3:5), the big government must use various forms of false prophets (most of the false prophets are popular athiests with a PhD degree) to implement thought control, and ultimately use satan’s thoughts to achieve the goal of Tower of Babel. That’s why God warned us, in the unity of Tower of Babel, all the people together “worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?” (Revelation 13:4). Therefore, big governments such as USA and PRC are actually the Antichrist imitating the rule of Christ, replacing the Kingdom of God with a counterfeit Kingdom of Heaven and earth. Today in 21st century, with the development of overproduction, socialist capital, globalization, welfare society, digital payment, big data, artificial intelligence, and network censorship, the world has formed a huge “socialist + state-influenced capital + state-operated technology + state-interested media + unintelligent entertainment. The athiest humanistic combination of education and politics makes it increasingly possible for a Leviathan-style big government to control the world as One World Order. Maybe it is not a conspiracy, but just, even worse, an evil manifestation created by the gullible majority.</p>
<p>Do we choose just one Wedding of the Lamb, or repeat the Seven Trumpets? I believe God told me He has given us free will to decide, but many of us didn’t get the memo.</p>
