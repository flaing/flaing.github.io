<p>Life is lonely, but long, as people thought that’s crowded, but short. </p>
<p>If Edwin and Rudi lived in another world, they might be isolated, destroyed. In this world, they were invincible, impeccable, strong, with their frost monk or fire mage abilities. Without those abilities, perhaps in a world, they were just a pity, miserable and marred, for, after all, they were lonely by nature. Their loneliness came from their principles. People were not so clean, yet make white lies or cheat everyday, as Rudi and Edwin’s personal principles allow them not. They were different, while the difference from majority, especially major sins, is a curse. A curse that isolates you from others, where people could call upon you, Not Normal, sometimes even Stupid or Unwise. </p>
<p>They were. </p>
<p>Of course, they expected friends and lovers. But the human natures would deviate their friends and lovers. Lies, Hatreds, Infidelity, Betrays, Backstabbing. That’s normal. No normal one can prevent from those sins, yet Rudi and Edwin can’t even join the natural sins that grant the two blessing of “normal”, and that curse the two into lonely. </p>
<p>Rudi was usually cold. Edwin was usually heated. But they were both lonely.</p>
<p>Everyone in this world knew dragons were deceitful. But how about human kinds? Can they really trust each other? The answer is simple. </p>
<p>Dreams can divide into reflected or stored. Reflected dreams were triggered by stems, events, feelings, such as a radon pain feeling in the past that you forgot what actually it was. They were not preventable, nor intend-able.  Stored dreams were generated by desires, daydreams, aspirations, such as a specific pain that you remembered, or made up. </p>
<p>Warlocks or shadow dragons were masters of dreams, especially those who were recognised as “guru of dreams”. They could bring dreams to life. When a dream was brought to life, it could be a dispellable  buff, or indeed, debuff. Dangerous burdens of hallucinations were they, making the victims fall, due to “their own decisions”. Unnoticeable. </p>
<p>Apparently, despite empowerment of their abilities, both Rudi and Edwin were prone to dispellable curses, debuffs. Rudi’s was his love, hope for family. Edwin’s was his fear, unwillingness for being utilised.</p>
<p>They were fair but tough in their opposite ways, one cold, one heated. Yet they shared similar vulnerabilities. They were victims in their past; unfortunately, might also in their futures. </p>
<p>What was waiting for them? Was that danger? Could their abilities protect them? No one ever knew at this moment. The four tortollan bartenders and the druid, along with all other customers if they paid attention around their faces, had no clues of the two: the drunk, sleepy fire mage, and the sorrowful, sweepy frost monk. Time froze. </p>
<p>Now, Rudi relied on protection, yet Edwin relied on aggression. Their blindfolds were obvious. </p>
<p>The elixir of the healing of the two might be “the pride equilibrium”. The mage used to pride-generated energy, having too much pride, whilst the monk used to pride-restraint energy, having too little pride. Should they find the equilibrium in their opposite hearts, they might solve the same problem in opposite directions. But this was just a thought, anticipation. You never know. </p>

          <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="11"><a href="#11" class="headerlink" title="11"></a>11</h1><p>“Sometimes you are really too soft.” Edwin sipped his wine.<br>“Aye, sometimes I really have problem of judgements. ” Rudi quaffed his nip of whisky.<br>“You just can’t face the truth, that somebody sometimes cannot be saved. You thought you can forgive. How about your own survival? ” Edwin said.””<br>“Aye. “ Rudi.<br>“You thought you can handle that. Sometimes you thought you can heal them. No, you not, but just cost your own life. ”Edwin continued, “You really should have your own family, in lieu of extending your love whimsically. ” Edwin put and concluded.<br>“O why are you always so wise. ” Rudi.<br>“For I burn and cleanse. ” as Edwin joked, he continued “You really need. You have to. ”<br>“Mayhaps.” Rudi quaffed another nip of whisky. </p>
<p>Here is the bar under water, supported by magic of torsollans. The owners were Leonardo, Donatello, Michelingelo, and Raphael. They were ninjas before they retired and owned this bar. They were all good bartenders, though both Rudi and Edwin didn’t bought any cocktails. O, maybe Rudi’s scotch could be regarded as a “blended cocktail before distillery”? </p>
<p>They drank cup after cup, bottle after bottle, until the sunrise in the other day. </p>
<p>“Look at that. You are drunk. ” Rudi put.<br>“No I didn’t! “ Edwin said.<br>“Hah ha. Look at you. ” Rudi.<br>“No no, I don’t. Buddy. ” as Edwin said, he snored, happened put his left hand his finger hand in front of his mouth, breathed a fire.<br>“Woh woh woh. Hey! Gentlemen! ” Raphael said.<br>“Edwin, don’t burn our small piece of ma and pa, ok? ” Leonardo added.<br>Then Leonardo, Donatello, Michelingelo, Raphael, Rudi and Edwin all laughed. </p>
<p>“You know your problem? “ Edwin continued, “your grandpa. Your code of love, care and forgive. But our world is not that clean, but filthy. So you need continuously lie to yourself. You love even your enemies when they want to hurt you. You can read the airs, but you let others cheat you, for you lie to yourself and justify their evildoings. “<br>“You are talking about subconsciousness. “ Rudi said.<br>“And I won’t let them control, bother, hurt and burden me, if I were you. “ Edwin continued, “I would cleanse my problems with flames. I save myself before saving others. Let alone someone you cannot save due to their own decisions. “ </p>
<p>“So what’s your problem, Edwin?” said Donatello.<br>“We want to find someone. ” said Edwin.<br>“You who? ” said Donatello.<br>“Sadly, we don’t know. ” Edwin.<br>“Hmm. Interesting. ” Donatello.<br>“A dragon claimed an identity unto Edwin, and deceived an important possession. Unto same location, where he claimed to be a king, we found him not. They’re gone, both our thing and this guy. ” Rudi.<br>“Dragons? They are usually deceitful. Everybody knows, especially when they thought cheating on human kinds no big deal. “ Donatello.<br>“And we got to find our thing. ” Rudi.<br>“What kind of thing? “ Donatello.<br>“A shoulderguard. ”Rudi. </p>
<p>Then Donatello ruminated. said Wiping the cup, Michelingelo added, “usually, when a dragon got a thing from you, you can’t trace it back. ”. Leonardo then said, “In fact, Raphael also lost a thing from dragons. For decades, you had found it til we faced the reality. ”</p>
<p>Michelingelo said, “man, they are socerers, if not powerful then them. They had skins and armours. They casted magic, yet required no casting time, unlike human-kind mages. You could kill them, but well, they are tough guys. ”</p>
<p>Donatello said, “their invasions were thru-o history of human kind. The origin of eastern new year was also due to them. You know, they were no folklores. They were true stories. Nians killed and ate children for snacks. Human kinds don’t eat young monkeys for snacks, for monkeys are smart and have emotions. But for dragons, they can’t care less. Eat eat eat. Cheat cheat cheat. They thought everything belongs to them. ”</p>
<p>Rudi said, “my friend can cast spells instantly, and he wears artefact armours. I guard him, as he fires, all of dragons burn. “<br>Leonardo said, “sounds like a plan. Hah. “</p>
<p>Rudi then approached to a girl, saying, “your eyes are not jewellery, are they? “<br>The girl laughed, answered, “well. This line is not impressive. “<br>“This is not a line, but an objective observation. “ Rudi.<br>“Whoa? Are you kidding me? “ said the girl.<br>“Rudi. “ said Rudi.<br>“Seraphine. “ said the girl.<br>“Good name but long, like your hairs. “ said Rudi.<br>“What brings you here? “ said Seraphine.<br>“Wind. “ Rudi nodded, “cold wind in eternal ice. “<br>“Ah… “ Seraphine.<br>“Not yet in Seraphine’s eyes. “ Rudi put.<br>“O… “<br>“So what do you drink, tonight? “ Rudi.<br>“Burning Insects juice, I guess? “ Seraphine.<br>“That’s sweet, right, Leonardo? Not a pro in cocktails, let alone your profound naming system. “ yelled Rudi.<br>“Definitely. Why don’t you try even one in our bar. You are boring, ordering the same whisky all the time. “ Leonardo.<br>“No. I won’t. “ yelled Rudi, then he told unto Seraphine in his usual low, cold voice, “alright. I just want to say your eyes are petty. Nice to see them. “<br>“Well. Thank you. “ Seraphine put, eyeing on Rudi continuously.</p>
<p>Rudi got back seat. Edwin said, “are you kidding me? What are you doing. “<br>“That’s enough. I just want to say thanks, for her eyes brighten my night. “ replied Rudi.<br>“Come on! “ said Edwin, “ she’s interested in you! “<br>“No she doesn’t. And whatever. “ said Rudi. Then they talked about all kind of things, such as work, missions, memories. Also they talked to the owners of the bar. They tortollans were pretty old. </p>
<p>Later, the girl approached him, “you are kind of funny. What you do? “<br>“We are finding a dragon, or a group of dragons. “ said Rudi, “yet we still did nothing, til we have clues. “</p>
<p>“What for? They are rogues. “ she said.<br>“Our item was deceived, “ said Rudi.<br>“No change for you to take back. “<br>“Did you hear any dragons, occasionally? “<br>“I am not sure. “<br>“Are you a resident here? “<br>“Yes, I live here since I was born. “<br>“How old are you? “<br>“25. “<br>“15 years younger than I. “<br>“Really. You look young. “<br>“Don’t bald, moustache look old? “<br>“No but look cold. Like you said, you were brought by cold winds. “<br>“Well but thou art starting melting me. “<br>“Actually I am a Druid. “<br>“So you know instinct. “<br>“A bit. “<br>“You prefer instinct or fate? “<br>“Why? “<br>“I meditate every night for our thing. “<br>“Oh come on. What so important? And you have no chance. “<br>“Summon your flame blade. “<br>“What?! “<br>“Summon. Try me. “ Rudi said.<br>Then the girl smiled, beamed, as if been flirted. She hesitated a second, “alright. “ then she was summoning the fire element, a very important spell in so-called equilibrium arts, before structuring any so-called the wraths of nature. Then she formed the element into a flame blade unto her beautiful brown meticulously amber-like right hand.<br>“Pretty… “ said Rudi.<br>Then the girl stroke him with the blade, smiling. That’s a big but artless blow, for she predicted Rudi to dodge, while he didn’t. The blade cut thru the body. “Oh… sorry. “ she was shocked, but right in another second, she was shocked even worse. Her blade was frozen for some reason. What? Impossible.<br>“…Much. “ said Rudi, “I like your hand. “ Rudi continued to tease the girl, “jewellery eyes, amber-like hand… anything else beautiful? “<br>“How can it be… flame blade is one of the most destructive and stable weapon in my wrath of nature. Let alone it cannot be dispelled. “ said the girl, trembling.<br>“Now, may we have a chance, “ Rudi paused, “… against dragons? “ said Rudi. The girl was stunned, also stunning, so he got the girl with one big step closer. He stopped, gently, yet firmly, kissing her forehead, as he couldn’t help himself. He continued, coldly and lowly, “You smell good. “<br>He paused again, “so, did you really not hear anything related to dragons? “<br>“Actually, I… “ the girl nervously stammered, “acknowledged a clan of dragons here. Not precisely, I meant. Wait… Let me think. “<br>Idled Rudi, smiling.<br>Then she continued, “you are really strange. “<br>With beam wore, Rudi coked a bit, “You are strange, too. ”</p>
<p>Suddenly, didn’t know why, Rudi recalled, or even missed, his ex-wife. They were together for more than 8 years. Before she left her, she said, Have been unhappy for many years with you the wrong guy, while Rudi didn’t know any single sign. After she left him for 3 months, she said unto him, I have been seeing someone else now, good bye Rudi, focus on yourself. Yet how could Rudi focus on his hollow self? </p>
<p>He hoped her everything fine, yet still felt painful, for he loved her so much, so deep, more than himself. She commented their relationship as “Wicked Love”, and he didn’t know why. He tried his best to complement her, comfort her, even in arguments. But it turned out, those were just perfunctory communications in her sights and ears. </p>
<p>Maybe, to her, he is just someone who didn’t know the art of words, and no reason for this to work out. Let alone she threatened him occasionally, and sued him. Still, full of sweet memory were in his minds. To Rudi, sourness cannot bury sweeties. Apparently, her ex-partner had different opinion. After all, he knew she forgot him as she said, yet he still occasionally recalled her, or missed her, like this moment. </p>
<p>“Hey, are you okay? ” said Seraphine.<br>“I don’t know. “ said Rudi. </p>

          <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="Chapter-X"><a href="#Chapter-X" class="headerlink" title="Chapter X"></a>Chapter X</h1><p>It was a huge waterfall. Rudi passed first, watching. He seemed to see dragons, but he wasn’t sure. </p>
<p>Dragons were powerful animals, but still animals. Their power came from each their special talents when they decided their “path” or alignment. For example, shadow dragons knew how to hide themselves and how to manipulate minds. That was the profession as Warlock came from. Human kinds learnt from dragons, a lot. But in turn, dragons regarded human kinds sort of “pettable” animals. Usually they used human kinds for their own profits. Indeed, human kinds also learnt and improved their sinful tricks from dragons. </p>
<p>So Rudi wasn’t sure whether there was a dragon, due to, if any, shadow tricks from shadow dragons. He could read the airs, so he started to predict: “20%”<br>“50%”<br>“90%”<br>As he got closer and closer, he assured more and more.<br>“What the hack are you doing? “ Edwin yelled abruptly.<br>“Shh, they were near. “<br>“Who? “<br>“Some dragons. I am sure now. “ Rudi.<br>“Don’t fear. I am blood-oathed. “ </p>
<p>As Edwin concluded as such, Rudi couldn’t explain, for it’s dangerous to be distracted now. Dragons, despite also a specie of mortal animals, were unpredictably powerful. </p>
<p>“Do you know how close you came to getting yourself shot? “ a dark, low-pitch, loud voice came thru the airs until it hit Rudi’s ears. Aye, 100% there were dragon, or dragons. </p>
<p>Rudi started to mediate, finding more than one dragon near. 1, 2, 3…, oh, maybe 10. </p>
<p>“I did once I saw your gun or magic at my face… Joking, no offence. “ Rudi replied in the same low-pitch, coldly. </p>
<p>“How dare you?! “ dragons roared.<br>“Here is a misunderstood. My apologies, Brothers. I am actually blood-oathed with your king. “ Edwin said shortly, eloquently.<br>“What the hell blood are you mentioning? Mortal in armour. And which king do you suggest? Do you know our society? Burger King? “ one dragon said.<br>Edwin paled. He didn’t expect that.<br>“Why don’t you guys get away from us before my friend grills you into crispy yummy dragon chips? “ Rudi said, again, coldly and confidently. Dragons never saw such rudeness. Perhaps that’s why Rudi was named for.<br>“Well. Well. Well. Interesting. But you are right. We decide to either kill you both, or take away all the possessions of you both. What is your call? “ one dragon said.<br>“Do you see any gear in me? Big guy, oh, big guys. “<br>“You never know. We can see thru your dead bodies if you don’t mind. What’s your call? “ Another dragon added.<br>“I hope no trouble. Why don’t you just go away now? ” Rudi.<br>“I am afraid not. ” Dragon replied.<br>“Please go away and make peace. ” Rudi.<br>“You fear? ” Dragon.<br>“You feel that way? ” Rudi.<br>“No…. that’s strange. ” Just as a dragon answered as such, another two dragons threw shadow bolts, and two dragons shadow danced into the back of Rudi, backstabbing with their shadow claws.<br>Rudi knew that, freezing the bolts crossing the zone radius of 5 m around him, and dodging the two stabbings.<br>“Art ye serious? Lads? ” Just as Rudi said, he started the storm of kicks and fists. The shadow bolts were reflected, and the stabbing dragons got hurt, with one wing broken in one dragon’s body. The shadow bolts flew back unto the shooters, hurting them. Rudi breathed alcohol disorienting the dragons near then, kicking thru the way unto the shooters. He touched his fingers, if not jabbed, into the skins of two dragons, as they seemed poisoned by ice.<br>“Edwin? ” Rudi said.<br>“What have I done… I fear… ”<br>“Don’t fear. Edwin. It happened. We will figure it out later. Now we are in combat. ” Rudi.<br>“I can’t think. “<br>“Then show your anger. ” Rudi.<br>Still idle, Edwin stood with a sorrowful and regretful face, thinking about his Legendary Artefact shoulderguard “blood-oathed and saved”, but responding not. Other dragons jerked some attacks, magic or gun, at Edwin. Rudi froze the attacks for Edwin, and dashed unto Edwin for “catching” the assaults for Edwin with his body.<br>“Who are you… human kind. ” One dragon marvelled at Rudi.<br>“Wake up, Edwin. You are just in self-doubt. Be not! Back to life! ” Rudi whispered, but Edwin could hear that. As Rudi got hit, or caught the assaults with his body, he buffeted on the ground vigorously with his left palm, if not violently. The ground cracked, with some into ice flakes.<br>“This guy is crazy. ” One dragon added.<br>“What you did? ” One dragon asked.<br>“I programmed, debugging,. You are the bugs. Now you can still leave, if you don’t want to get hurt. “ Rudi said.<br>“Alright. We will no troubles here … ” one injured dragon said, and the other hurt ones agreed.<br> Then Rudi stopped all the things, firmly. As he thought there’s no trouble anymore, some dragon blew him in the back from shadow dancing.<br>Despite enduring those attacks, Rudi was regretful in hurt feeling, for he trusted the words of deceits, again, in fact, even after knowing they can’t be trusted.<br>“My lesson is pride issue. Your lesson is forgiveness issue. ” Edwin commented, joked. “Yeah, I am back to life. ” Then he started to scorch the dragons near Rudi and himself, splashing the flames unto the other dragons. He raised his mace later, “Burn,” as he said, all the dragon ignited. Then Rudi breathed frost alcohols again unto them, as their skins burnt to crispy.<br>“Ahh… no… ”<br>“Now we trust you not. ” As Edwin said, he channeled flames again, then summoning three small size meteorites. As they landed, dragon got hurt faintly. “But this time, I slow my cook. ” He then summon a small “charcoal-like” flame under each dragon’s body, whether live or not, cooking. Fire burning sounds everywhere.<br>“Origin or extra crispy? Mon Ami? ” Edwin asked, joking.<br>“In this situation, Mr. chef, I have only one option. ” Rudi replied. </p>

          <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="Chapter-IX-no-one-cares-or-nothing"><a href="#Chapter-IX-no-one-cares-or-nothing" class="headerlink" title="Chapter IX: no one cares, or nothing"></a>Chapter IX: no one cares, or nothing</h1><p>Rudi was recalling his time. </p>
<p>“Torture him. Torture him. ”</p>
<p>“He is evil and mean. I can tell by his appearance. Let’s prevent it before it even exists. ”</p>
<p>“He got problems. ”</p>
<p>“He is so annoying. ”</p>
<p>“He is my burden. ”</p>
<p>People yelled, around the cage, or simply a tiny hutch, where Rudi “lived” in. He was chained by several shackles and jesses. He wore a piece of cloth, if not nothing. He was damp, for people occasionally spited on him, and full of blood around the body, for people hurt him for fun, by any interesting weapons punishment instruments. Conventional people’s youth time is usually happy hours, but his isn’t, apparently, if not worse than torture. </p>
<p>“He deserves it. ”</p>
<p>“He is worst person I ever met. ”</p>
<p>“He might be clever, but he uses in wrong way. ”</p>
<p>“But what did he properly do wrong? ”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. “</p>
<p>“I don’t know either. But because he is a looser, it’s obviously his fault. ”</p>
<p>“Oh good point! “</p>
<p>“So. We don’t know the facts but who cares? ”</p>
<p>“Yeah. He deserves it. ”</p>
<p>“That’s not close enough. “</p>
<p>His arm and leg were obvious crippled, festered, and you don’t want to know why and how. </p>
<p>“Let him calm himself. ”</p>
<p>“He is so prideful. ”</p>
<p>“I hate his eyes. ”</p>
<p>“Something wrong in his head. ”</p>
<p>“He is so negative. ”</p>
<p>“So negative! “</p>
<p>“Negative! ”</p>
<p>All negativisms and sarcasms around him, ironically, people around him said Rudi is negative. He is calm and positive, yet called negative, by somebody spitting, hating, attacking, cursing, and torturing. </p>
<p>“Burn him in hell. ”</p>
<p>“Burn!”</p>
<p>“We are already treating you pretty good, Rudi. You deserves it. ”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you don’t need face and dignity. You should be put to death. ”</p>
<p>“Yeah, so now you are already very lucky. You should thank! ”</p>
<p>“We are teaching you! “</p>
<p>So people also burnt him with fire or red-hot iron. When they did, Rudi could only calm him down, freezing the wounds, hurts, pains, injuries in his imagination. Blessed, he learnt great deals upon the tortures and punishments from his inner power of frost. He was too focus on his inner power, as to avoid being really hurt by those people around him. In addition, aye, ironically he really thanked and forgave those around him who tortured and taught him, somehow?! He didn’t know he was becoming a frost monk, and his flesh and bones were also turning profoundly —— Although no one cares.</p>
<p>He fainted. </p>
<hr>
<p>In his dream, he remembered several dialogues with his closest fellows. </p>
<p>They said things like this: </p>
<p>“I am the one who concerns about you the most. “</p>
<p>“Thank you. And I respect that. “ Rudi replied. </p>
<p>“They despise you but I love you the most. “</p>
<p>“Ok. I love you too. But I don’t care what others said. No matter what happened, I forgive them. “ Rudi replied. </p>
<p>“No, You should hate them. You should have judgement. “</p>
<p>“I feel for you and it’s all her fault. I hate her for your past, you hate her, don’t you? “</p>
<p>“I don’t hate anyone. I forgave her. “ Rudi. </p>
<p>“Then you are fool. You don’t know what happened. “</p>
<p>“I knew what happened and I forgave her. But thank you. “ Rudi. </p>
<p>Despite this, all those guys told bad things behind Rudi’s back, ironically. He was the only one said only positive things, yet everybody backstabbed him. </p>
<p>Or, </p>
<p>“He is evil and mean. “</p>
<p>“How do you know. “ Rudi.</p>
<p>“I have judgement and you are dumb but don’t have judgement and nor do you know a thing. You were cheated, hoaxed, misled. I am teaching you. But you keep standing with him but not with me. You spoke more already, which is good, but not close enough. What is your judgement? “</p>
<p>“My judgement is that you and he should get alone with each other, trusting each other. Don’t think that way, despite its hardness. Don’t follow the bad feelings but the good faiths! Please. “ Rudi. </p>
<p>“You don’t know things. It’s impossible. I am different from him. He is mean, fake. “</p>
<p>“You are similar, for you both have good hearts, helping others. Just stop thinking that way. Love and care should be the only thing important. “ Rudi. </p>
<p>“Ok. Stop. “</p>
<p>Similar dialogues happened in another end in the pair. And between each different pair, similarities arose, too. </p>
<p>Ironically also, some of those pairs called Rudi the backstabber who alienates people?! “ How could they? But I can only forgive them… “ Rudi didn’t really understand that, for Rudi knew not the complexity of human natures. Sounds like he also lacks human natures. This also contributed his special ability: Reading The Airs, for he knew the natures in his own exclusive way, for lacking human natures also granted him peace of mind objectively to know the airs, and to “find the centre”. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, even though Rudi kept silent in other scenario, which he usually did, he got trouble, even more severely than said as such. Fortunately, this Reading The Air ability became his combat martial arts. </p>
<p>Like in our world, Jesus was the one under crucifixion, spits, for He hath no faults. </p>
<p>Of course Rudi is not Jesus, let alone presence in our world. He was a monk in his world. Maybe he was just extremely unwise, naïve, stupid brat. He doesn’t know. Only God knows. </p>

<p>“Fuck that’s pretty high. I will fall. ”</p>
<p>“No. We won’t. And you are awesome. ”</p>
<p>“Man. Don’t you know how heavy my armour is??“</p>
<p>“Aye I knew.”</p>
<p>“And don’t you see how shabby this drawbridge is? ”</p>
<p>“Even if we fall, we won’t die. “</p>
<p>“But I hate that! Man! “ Edwin concluded. </p>
<p>Their case, as expected, was a winning one. But Edwin didn’t burn them as he thought, for burning lawyers doesn’t change anything, to his prudence. He wanted something bigger.</p>
<p>He was an paid public inquisitor in his home town on the south. That job was nice and liberal in terms of timetables, so he could do whatever he wanted, planning his own projects and deadlines. If not, he would just quit within a second, for he concerns about freedom the most. Let alone social activities. Apart from some female agents - categorised as cute girls, or so-called the fuckable - he didn’t want to engage in any kind of meetups, dinners, or parties. Aye, all he wanted to do at that time, after calling a day, was getting away from any work or colleagues. He went museum and shopping sometimes, for he loved cooking and artworks, otherwise, he just went home. </p>
<p>Now their newest project was totally striking this thirsty, or any other addiction, supply chains.</p>
<p>“Well. By the way, what was your old pauldron? didn’t see that. ”</p>
<p>“Oh. I got a good deal. Those dragons gonna fear me, for I had blood oath with that dragon clan. ”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? ”</p>
<p>“You don’t understand. You will see that. “</p>
<p>“Just so you knew, even your former pauldron was a artefact legendary armour. Be careful. Human kinds are selfish, let alone dragons. ”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I knew what I am doing. “</p>
<p>“Sometimes you don’t, until you learn the lesson later, especially when you want something just too badly. ”</p>
<p>“Oh man! They really gave what I wanted, let alone I got this special offer. Not everyone like me can sign a contract with dragon, let alone a Blood Oath with them! “</p>
<p>“Well, Blood Oath…” For Rudi can read the airs, he knew something was wrong, but he loves Edwin so much, hurting his feelings not, thereby keeping silent at this moment after their discussion on the drawbridge. But he was going to figure out what happened, for to his understanding, blood is blood, regardless of any form or source or race. Dragon’s Blood wasn’t any more special. Maybe he was wrong, but he gonna analyse, eviscerate any conspiracy. </p>
<p>“I can’t bear that anymore!” Edwin said, burn a tree, and dashed-in-flames, from the drawbridge.</p>
<p>“That was a training. But anyway. ” Rudi reacted. </p>
<p>“You know what? I really like that girl. Her orgasm was real, I could feel it, man, she nearly bit me with her nails when orgasm! And I loved it when he did that. “</p>
<p>“Aye”</p>
<p>“But her bad breath… man, was unbearable, while I didn’t want to hurt her. I indirectly notified her, that’s what I did, but she… she still thought reluctance. “</p>
<p>“That’s her mind. “</p>
<p>“But I felt bad. I want perfection! “</p>
<p>“I understand. But again, it’s just her mind. Everyone has his her individual mind. “</p>
<p>“But she should listen to me, or at least it’s my responsibility. “</p>
<p>“Nay. Not your responsibility. You had done your best. “</p>
<p>“I don’t care. I care. “</p>
<p>“Well. Don’t burden the heart, for the heart is the strongest muscle, the last hope. “ Rudi uttered. </p>
<hr>
<p>“Give us the money or lay down. You two are surrounded. I will make it quick. “</p>
<p>“Other idiots. “ Edwin started his anger. </p>
<p>“Don’t do that. I am in charge. “ As Rudi said, he dashed upon those guys in lightening speed, and he breathed strong frost alcohol. As such, he frozen and drunk those rogues, who thought they could make them hard time and block their way. </p>
<p>“That’s not right. Rudi. Even they cannot offend us, they could always offend others. They are evil, they can’t change. They must be cleansed. For in this world, killing is legal, they can always get away from any punishment! And our world has no death penalty. Trust me, they’d better just burn and die. “ then Edwin raised his ring hand, fasten into fist, and opened his palm. As such, at the same time, all the bodies of those frozen and drunk rogues blasted into charred crispy meats, flying everywhere, except for their complete heads. “In memory of their sins, I left their heads complete. “ then he hanged their heads onto the tree with ropes, indeed, made by his force magic. </p>
<p>“Well okay. Sometimes this is brutally needed, despite unwanted. “ Rudi commented shortly after this hazard. Before they left, Edwin charred the ground, burning “Death to all evildoers who sin, and who think they can get away from the ending like this. “ another spectacular artworks from Edwin. </p>

<p>“Tell me, vitualising it. “</p>
<p>“I can put it unto your head, but I can’t vitualise it, for I am not a mage like you. “</p>
<p>“Come on. But I need see that with my eyes. My damage can only be done one hundred percents with good sights. “</p>
<p>“Maybe that direction. I am not sure. They are using demonic gateway for their virtual private networks, where I cannot penetrate into, let alone telling you properly and precisely. “ Rudi played his mustache and beard thin as he explained. </p>
<p>“Then if you do it, I cannot fully cover you with my fire. You will be damaged hugely before I can see and fire. “</p>
<p>“I born to endure damage. No worry. “</p>
<p>“Man. You are <em>Bald</em>. “</p>
<p>“Aye my bald head is the answer. “</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s do it. “</p>
<p>Then the monk started to reveal their intents with his <em>Eye of Mind</em>. He freezed some Thirsty Enegy in the air, along with the <em>tracer ruins</em> ejected by his Chi. He ejected his Chi to show the presence of both ends, such that he let Edwin the lawyer prove about Warlocks collecting energy from human sins upon a bloody events.</p>
<p>But in this nation, everyone has the right to kill if they get the balls and power. This in the law is the Principle of Self Protection. So the warlocks arm themselves with destruction spells. If they can kill the invaders and cage all the evidence seekers, they can provide their innocence, no matter what people think of them. </p>
<p>Let alone their good reputation and decent privilege. In fact, it’s hard to be a mage or a warlock, as so many laymen send their children studying magic. But usually warlocks are higher caste by family background, compare to what middleclass as to mage -indeed, only if they succeed- only 0.1% of all the trainees finally make it as a mage or a warlock. Again, this is a very challenging study and career. It needs a lot of efforts and training. After study, many nations require magic practitioners -so-called mage or warlocks- to have at least 3 years clinical training by a certified institute before they can sit in the bar for Licensed Magic Practitioner Test. </p>
<p>Now, the monk was <em>hacking</em> the access point of energy transportation with his freezing kick. He already collected many tracer ruins -his data and records for evidence of Edwin’s case- in this access point. Now he only need to take it with them. </p>
<p>“Bald falk. Don’t you know how many traps are here? I knew so many people want our business secrets. But no one like you just walks in. “</p>
<p>“I can’t hide before the eyes you put, so I hide not. “ The monk replied. </p>
<p>“Good point. But still, you need lay down. “</p>
<p>The warlock started to cast magic before the monk, as monk was stunned by a demonological trap. At least, he should, in fact, he wasn’t at all stunned, to the warlock’s surprise. </p>
<p>The whole atmosphere was darken, broken for eyesights, as if they were in another matrics of dimensions set. So Edwin can do nothing. This is a Time Wraaper Zone. </p>
<p>“Arise!”</p>
<p>Just as a bolt came from the warlock, spiraling and sinking, a pair of demonic claws <em>flowered</em> from underneath of the monk. </p>
<p>“I can’t stun you with my trap, but you will be slowed by my other spells, eating my bolt thereby. This is an art. You have no where to wrong. “ the warlock thought.</p>
<p>As he predicted, the bolt hit the target, causing a shadow swirl around the body of the monk. He was burn with dark fire, infected by the darkness, oozing dark blood. </p>
<p>But the swirl and the wound started to “slow down”, as if they were frozen. </p>
<p>“Frozen flesh can grant me peace. “ He couldn’t mitigate the pains, but could just take it as nothing. </p>
<p>Then the damage was staggered and frozen. </p>
<p>“You are a monstre, aren’t you? “ The warlock started to scortch him with dark fire. </p>
<p>“No. But just a monk, or a hermit. “ The monk again took the pains, swallowing them with his frozen flesh, staggering, as he finally walked near the warlock, and stroke with his powerful left fist. </p>
<p>He was expecting a knockout as he hit, but nothing happened. </p>
<p>The warlock blinked into another position, <em>kiting</em> this monk. Dark infections and dark burnings were still active onto the monk, despite frozen and staggered.</p>
<p>He could endure the pains, but it doesn’t mean the pains were tolerable and bearable! It’s about one million times the feeling of a woman giving birth. Tis why victims of such spells usually get stunned and feared. </p>
<p>He maintained his best to calm his painful mind, thinking about rivers and mountains. He knew, he had to hit at least three times in a raw -hard enough indeed- to actually hurt and stop the warlock.</p>
<p>This warlock enhanced and continuously manipulated the infections and scortch on the monk. If it’s conventional fighter or something -even the bravest- they can just run away or beg before the warlock for stopping. But he just calmly walked like a wind, near and near to the warlock. </p>
<p>“I am the supply chain manager. Don’t mess with me. “ The warlock said unto the painful monk. </p>
<p>“And your systems have many vulnerabilities. “ He threw the combination, finally. An uppercut hit the liver of the warlock. “And I study them. “ The monk added. </p>
<p>The warlock blinked again, back to the original position. But he feels his body and mind slowed down, if not frozen, as if he was <em>poisoned by the coldness</em>. </p>
<p>“You don’t… know my… power. I can… immolate… you. “</p>
<p>“And I can investigate you. My friend would sue you. “ Coldly the monk replied.</p>
<p>The warlock sneered, and blinked into other position again, starting casting another unknown spell. Rudi thought, what is so-called immolate? Will this warlock sacrifice himself for a self-desctruction explosion? Not likely, for mages and warlocks fear death and pains the most. </p>
<p>So he started to read the warlock’s mind, but in vein as he efforted, for warlock can hide their minds if they pay attentions. No clues. Anyhow, he got near the warlock again -finally- freezing the spell with his silky cold breeze onto the emerging magical energy, from his right hook unto the face of warlock. He halted the casting, if not worse than that, as the warlock cannot even breathe at this moment, for he felt the air was too cold…</p>
<p>Then his body softened, his mind knew the warlock’s in danger. Left kick onto his face -not yet, for the devil guard was summoned by the amulet on his neck, blocking the kick. </p>
<p>The demon is very huge, about three times the height of Rudi, a monk of 178cm. The demon -she- blocked with her right wing, as she coiled into a shell like. </p>
<p>“How dare you. “ The warlock said. </p>
<p>“I knew you were too tired to blink again at that moment. “</p>
<p>“You don’t belong here. I could kill you. “</p>
<p>“You already tried with no mercy. I knew you couldn’t. “</p>
<p>“And you cannot hurt me. Monk. Your attacks are just too … puny, pethatic. “ Warlock mocked.</p>
<p>“Constant drippings wear away a stone. And your gateway is our testimony. “</p>
<p>“Over my dead body. “ Then the warlock started to cast again, as bright green covering orange colour sparked on his fanning palms. </p>
<p>The monk knew he must be quick. But he can only run and walk in front of this experienced warlock -windwalk kind of kungfu was already the fastest way to his limit, for he is not conventional rolling, flying, jumping and dancing kind of aggresive martial artists. He is the shield with no defect, but also the shield with no harm and slash. His head is more rock-solid than the heaviest-forged shield of a vindicated warrior or a paladin. That’s why -to him- he wears no arms, but just a shabby light cloth robe, without any single enhancement. </p>
<p>He knew he can’t just take the access point and run away, for warlock can mar him in any kind, even if he cannot kill him.</p>
<p>He wasn’t frustrated -by the mobility of the warlock- but indeed puzzled a lot. And he can hardly deal any significance. </p>
<p>“You are… a worthy opponent. “ The warlock put. </p>
<p>The combat continued another couple of minutes. There was, until then, no sign of ending. </p>

Edwin started playing his plates. He lifted one plate in right shouder up with his magic Force. Under the plate, he wore a shirt, only lightly covering his tattoos on the skins. In fact, each plate had each tattoo as ruin on the skin. That’s why he could take off and arm his plates so swiftly. His armor isn’t nessesary powered gear, but it is robust, polished, enhanced by his power. When he took the armor off, the armor became a cube. In this world, there wasn’t so much thing to do with gears, for every material is just material. Power comes from the user, spirits and skills. He wore them because he loves the appearance. So frequently he switched his “suits” if the armor wasn’t a right fit. Edwin’s newsest armor is shined with golden colour. </p>
<p>“He took so long time. Is he in trouble? “ He worried as he thought. “But, man, he’s nearly invincible regarding damages… I doubt anyone can hurt him. “</p>
<p>“This monk a ‘tank’, a unlimited container. “</p>
<p>“But there is no reason to take that long. “</p>
<p>He really wanted to come in the Zone then help, but he couldn’t, for this was a great risk. Anyone can strike him from behind. And he has no eyesights inside the Zone. No eyesights no damage. There wasn’t a sign for him to even just light a candle with his endless magicforce, for the darkness was controlled by warlock’s magic, but not due to nature. Despite wearing the plates, strike from behind could be deadly for the big “cannon” Edwin. After all, though a cannon is strong enough destroying any target, it is not a tank which endures. Until then, he knew nothing inside the Zone. He cannot read the airs. So he kept waiting for right moment. The plan was for Rudi to turn off the switch of the Zone, such that he could see. </p>
<p>Now he was starting reading the tome on his waistbelt. That was gold and quartz texture -not only embedded- on the cover. It was a accessory, but more than a decoration. Like paladin and priest who chain a holy Bible on the waistbelt, he wore it, more elegantly and sumptuously. But this is not a holy bible. </p>
<p>“The girl was sensitive. When I hug her, she got wet, like a swamp in desert. And I kissed her like rains in oasis. Her nipples were nice, soft and pinkish red, hardened as I landed my tongue onto it, where I can lick for all night. They were all sensitive and cute. My caress is in every inch of her silky milky skin. “</p>
<p>He read what he narrated in the past with flatiron magic. No actual “pages” in his tome. All the written characters on page were all inked as such. Despite all magic, a layperson without knowledge of magic could also easily flip over “page” by page. He didn’t name the name of the tome. But you can call it diary of love and romance, although, to him, indeed it could be more important than Holy Bible. As he said, Cute girls are my energy, And you know nothing about my energy. The F&amp;F- his fire and force. </p>
<p>Already for an hour been waiting, “even if he died, I need carry his body. No reason for waiting even longer. “ he warmed up his blood a bit with the magic, and lit his ring on his right hand as his magical lamp. The force by him lifted his feet a bit onto the air, accelerating. He “walked” toward the corner, near and near. At certain point, however, the kindle on the ring couldn’t be seen, as if all the photons were absorbed by multiple black bodies. He feareth the darkness, for he anticipated the risk. They might all die. </p>
<p>“Shit. But I have to come thru the fear.” The environment put irrefutable fear, stress, and pressure on any creature getting near. The nearer, the more intense, that apparently no one can bear, for this is the intuition of creatures, whether living kinds or not, let alone human kinds. Warlocks are experts for manipulations upon intuitions. Edwin was resisting this intuition by his best. </p>
<p>He recalled many years ago, when they engaged with a army of human kinds. Right before the fight, the monk told him about the sorrowful stories: The monk was 7 years younger than he. His family was destroyed. His ex-wife sued him. He was tortured in a cage, where every decent man -including his own family leftovers- participated in the cruel ritual. They burnt every inch of the festered skins on the monk - if they were still skins. They smashed bones of the monk. They shot stimulants, keeping the monk alive and sensitive for the endless torments. But the monk tried his best in meditation, numb. </p>
<p>So during that fight, the mage was in great danger when he was rooted in a snare as magic missiles channeled at him. He couldn’t dash with his magic force, let alone physical movements. He thought he was dying in seconds. But not until being bombed like a beehive, the monk fly kicked in. His kick seemed to slow and freeze the missiles a bit. Then, strangely, he drifted around the mage, blocking and catching all the missiles with his flesh, his back. The skins burnt in lights at once, but the explosions soon enervated, frozen and cool. Aye, the monk caught all the missiles with his flesh and bones… shielded with his skins, but with nothing else.</p>
<p>“You really are a monk… “ Edwin said, “more than that, you are a monk-ster. “</p>
<p>The monk was a watchman still, reading around any potential risk and hazard, so silent, without his usual joking back. </p>
<p>“Do you hear me? Man. But you were really slow. Why you didn’t just kick that guy on his head knocking him out cold! Man. “ </p>
<p>“I can’t deal that kind of burst damage. “ Rudi said. </p>
<p>“Now we are still trapped here. We must die and loose. I hate loosing, but I can’t figure out a way. I am fire mage, and they can resist most of my arts, let alone their damages are so fearful. I would just be bombed like a beehive, laying down like a waste. And after I die, they can just gather their armies against you. You will die soon. “</p>
<p>“You might be right. But don’t think like that. We can prevail. We can win. “</p>
<p>“Then show me how. This is so frustrated. They have all kinds of professions. I can’t do anything. “</p>
<p>“Remember, you are a mage in plates. And you structure, evoke fires with your wrath and emotions. They can’t stop you. “</p>
<p>“But this is not my fighting style at this moment. I want to win elegantly. “</p>
<p>“I knew. And in fact you already are. Just believe. Now, I will use my Chi Walls again, you cumulate your emotions upon the two opposite ends, until you can fully show them your wrath. “</p>
<p>“I can’t. This wastes my time! They can interfere our plan! “</p>
<p>“We are in charge, winning. Let alone no one can practically interfere your casting… your fires come from your emotions but not your concentrations, as you said. They have no chance against us. “</p>
<p>“Only if everything is right! Which is not! “</p>
<p>“Ok. Don’t worry. Now I am doing it. “ Rudi said coldly, starting the meditation sitting. </p>
<p>The wounds the blood started to solidify as the monk meditated. Then some leftovers of missiles flew out radiatively. During the time, green Chi gathered swirls, until they became ice cones-then ice walls. The two ends were identical. </p>
<p>Now the fire blazed in the mage’s eyes, as his fingers were heating. He raised his mace, roaring, there was a dragon’s head formed by flames, breathing, as many fireballs landed onto one end of the two ice walls. As a fireball hit one end, it bounced into the other end of the walls, reflecting continuously. There were too many, so as to turn out being a stream of lava between two ends. </p>
<p>“This is just a waste of time. And I am now angrier and angrier! “ Edwin complained, for he knew the enemies were too many, and they were no laypeople. They were professional soldiers and fighters. They knew how to manipulate and control, gearing good weapons, dealing good damages. They could counter our defence, as they also were clever, with strategies and tactics in minds. We should just try to negotiate our best bets in lieu of fighting for nothing, shit.  The more he thought, the angrier he was. He just wanted to burn, burning this shitty situation.</p>
<p>“Later they would slow me with their lights and curses, before the assassins would target on you. They want to cut loose your head, with their daggers in lightening speed, after the warriors would dash you to knock your head with their shield to disorienting you. Now my frozen Chi is protecting your neck. Don’t dodge. Again, don’t dodge! And don’t fire dash. Please. Just believe in your wraths. All you have to do is to melt the ground in flames with your cumulated wraths. Let them know who is their daddy. “</p>
<p>“Then I only have one shot. This doesn’t make sense. Anyone survives, I die. Then you will die, too. “</p>
<p>“Only if some members would try to kill me. Which they had tried and failed. They won’t try again, for they know they cannot cut thru my skins, let alone my bones. “</p>
<p>“And the gunners and mages will still be alive, shooting us. Then I will die. “</p>
<p>“I will absorb any damage. It’s painful, but after all, no significant damages for me. And I am fast, sure your safety. “ </p>
<p>“In theory. Only in your theory. What if we fail, we all die. “</p>
<p>“No worry. Now. “ Rudi yelled with his deep cold voice, praying it works. Even he never knew. Focus on positive things is the only thing he can do, for his life was a great sorrow. That’s how he survives. </p>
<p>Then Rudi faked as if he is paralysing the shooters. The enemies are experts of combats, so they knew Rudi has no damage. They thought the monk and wizard were just impatient and agitated. They thought their chances came. </p>
<p>Then the fighters dash onto the fire wizard Edwin, along with the shadow dances of assassins unto his back. Cut off the head, kill it, and win. </p>
<p>The other members slowed Rudi with greasing snares, so that the main damage dealers can kill Edwin with their bursts. </p>
<p>Then Edwin roared, “You fool mortals. “ bending over, hitting the ground with his mace of arcanite. “Burn! In my wrath and anger. “</p>
<p>The assassins showed up, spinning their body each, except one squatting in the front lower body of Edwin, as two fighters dashed on left, right side of Edwin. Edwin was focus, for he was angry. </p>
<p>When the daggers swung near the neck of the wizard, they were slowed by the frost Chi, along with the spiralling assassins’ hands gripping them. No assaults were successful just yet, at least during this wave of hits. </p>
<p>The man squatted in front of the wizard thought he got the good timing for a deadly strike, but he was wrong, as he reverse slashed with his long dagger from the bottom, or short sword, he just felt pain on his right hand…, which blew away. Burnt, exploded, withered, charred. “Ahh…” he screamed.</p>
<p>“My crotch is dangerous. Fool. “ he thought, but never said, for he was focusing on his deadly thermodynamics spells. </p>
<p>In this world, there are three laws in the thermodynamics: First law is the law of conservation, energy in each system is isolated, which means energy’s amounts are constant during a process. And the Second law is the law of irreversibility of natural process, which, once any process done, means entropy should only increase. And the Third law, suggesting the release of cumulated energy unto a state called residual entropy, is the backbone of all process. Edwin’s magic depends solely on the law of thermodynamics. So some of his abilities accumulating his wraths, which is not revertible process, and releasing wraths brings him back to his inner state into residual entropy times an unknown value, as such motions of his releasing wraths is the major source of damages he dealt. That’s why the tactics of monk and wizard could work, for the wraths generated are not reversible, until the wizard releases all of them, incinerating all the place into hell of flames. Let alone the two ends of walls accumulated the wraths and leftover heatings in much acceleration.</p>
<p>“Reduce.. To Aaaaaash. “ as he said, all the airs became a combustion of superheat. The water gasses were too high in temperature, as if there were fogs of flames, burning every each of anything. He visualised his anger into reality, if it’s not reality more than true, and cruel. Now even metals of weapon and gears were burning, as they were melting - all at once, actually, everything was incinerated, reducing to the ashes. </p>
<p>It was a total silence. Heating, no bodies, but all white colour powders. You don’t want to know what the powders were. Cremated, nothing left. </p>
<p>Fast, no concentration required. He casted this total destruction out under gang bangs. They could not interfere him by any chance. This is the rage wizard Edwin. </p>
<p>But now he still in his hesitation was sneaking, though he knew he should overcome the fears in heart. </p>
<p>“Maybe I just focus on cumulating wraths, so I don’t fear. “ good idea, he raised his ring hand, shooting fireballs in random directions. No hitting, no wraths, but at least preventing feeling of fears. </p>
<p>He sought to pull something with his Force. But in vein did he pull anything. This place is like a void. How did Rudi get in so fast? Or just it had different spaces? He didn’t know. He didn’t want to dwell in the feeling about it, for this just burdened him. He knew he need to deviate his unpleasant feelings. </p>
<p>So he kept pulling things, or at least air, and fingering fireballs on no targets. The space was so dark, that even fireballs couldn’t light the environment. But he finally found a way of marching: by random fireballs and force pulling he might sense direction, despite so eyesights. </p>
<p>He kept marching on his steps. Interestingly, he got the feelings of wraths energy. Aye, he hit something, or somebody, despite in total darkness. </p>
<p>Finally he saw a slight light upon his head. He knew this is the way. He used his force to pull himself onto the wall, or anything, crawling in the dark, drifting upward. </p>
<p>Now a burning shadow ghost showed up suddenly, behind his back. He knew that, fingering it, a flame fist in his image came out, devouring the already burning shadow ghost, before he kept drifting up with his Force. He looked more like a furious warrior with superpower than anything. </p>
<p>Then he finally saw the frost-injured senior warlock, and the monk in meditation. Sitting? He thought, but suddenly he knew the monk was doing the mind game against the warlock, for the warlocks are experts of minds, as, in fact, warlocks are too dependent to mind tricks, so sometimes significant defects are along with their practice of minds. Their advantage could be their greatest enemy. That’s also why the monk always said, my peace of mind is my strongest hold. </p>
<p>Then he raised his mace, ejecting a column of flames extending onto the warlock from his mace, burning the airs. As the monk, later, turned the frost Chi around the frost injuries in warlock’s body, into frozen alcohol, the body of warlock became a cage of extremely high pressure and heat. <em>Boom!</em> The body of the warlock bursted just like a blasted bloom. Blood and meats spread everywhere, before they burnt to coal, darkened. The black body parts and burnt-out blood were just another piece of Edwin’s artworks. </p>
<p>“So what postponed you so long? Man. “ Edwin said as if nothing ever happened. </p>
<p>“Hah ha, aye, I be damage dealer not like thou. You killed him in less than one second. “</p>
<p>“I don’t care. We should have more time talking and drinking. They are just trash. “</p>
<p>“Ah, haha, okay. Well, this is the evidence. “</p>
<p>“Who cares the evidence?!”</p>

          <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="Chapter-VII-the-memory-and-artefact"><a href="#Chapter-VII-the-memory-and-artefact" class="headerlink" title="Chapter VII: the memory, and artefact"></a>Chapter VII: the memory, and artefact</h1><p>The Ring of Scarlet was a possession - in fact, a legendary artefact, if not a legendary weapon - of the famous Arch Mage Madam Sherlock. She utilised this artefact to accelerate her chanting. Now it’s on the finger of Edwin, for Edwin’s casting requires on chanting, this is for him to outpour multiple flames at one time. </p>
<p>When Edwin was a lucky disciple of his pretty selective alma mater, Madam Sherlock considered him as one of the best student she ever had. Not so luckily, however, Edwin was a victim of bullies, for no reason, by some upright-considered regular and normal peers. Some “good student” just played around him. Sometime, even teachers joined this kind of harassments. But Madam Sherlock was different. She liked this kid. </p>
<p>When the bullies first started, he was always too afraid and angry to do anything proper. he wanted to fight back, even wanted to kill the bullies, especially when killing in all nations is legal in this world, but he was too vulnerable, too weak and too afraid of getting hurt. </p>
<p>But he still got hurt. A lot, both mentally and physically. He had severe injuries during his study, especially his right shoulder, due to the bullies. </p>
<p>While, Edwin is always a talented student, wasting no time. As he fired his first fireball, a very destructive wide-ranging spell in this world, when he was just 2 years old, his mastery exceeded a remarkable level when he was in college, growing. His misfortune, however, also contributed his mastery in another level, luckily. He focused on his own things, for he had no social activities. He pursued all kinds of arts in cooking, artworks, and, the most important, his personal style of casting. </p>
<p>He willed to waste no time, so he always sought a way to cast spells with no time. He was usually angry in his school life, especially during he was bullied. “Too angry to say a word” as he always thought and felt, he started to visualise his anger, and later, to visualise his casting process. He organised and planned various ways for making the process more vivid, and improved it, day by day. Finally, he found a way to utilise his anger to “chant” when he was “too angry to say a word”.</p>
<p>As he became stronger and stronger everyday, the bullies became less and less, perhaps due to the general maturity of the age of students, though he still hated the bullies and the ugly world, even until now. That’s why he wanted to burn so badly as to cleanse this dirty filthy world. Bad guys should be put to death, but this world doesn’t have death penalty, when killing alone is ironically legal, he is more than willing to get his hands dirty killing these evildoers. Burning, for revengeance. </p>
<p>Right before his graduation, his proud teacher Madam Sherlock granted him this ring - The Ring Of Scarlet, and fixed him up with his first girlfriend, or at least first sex partner, Elena. This is another story. </p>
<hr>
<p>Most so-called sorrowful people’s sorrows came from the witness of great sorrows, or just claiming so. But the monk’s sorrows were anecdotal, personal, and real in every inch of his skins. </p>
<p>Suffering and bleeding, endlessly, until he appreciated the beauty of death and hollow, with eyes more than pale. That was the only thing in his past. </p>
<p>After escape, and exile, from the endless torments, for years he has traveled and meditated in total coldness, as nothing seems never to take away. Aye, having nothing, yet things kept being took away. That’s the history of Rudi. His life, possessions, family, relationships were took away, if not everything.  </p>
<p>But there is no hatreds, strangely. For he lost his hope, time after time for everything, he only wants to forget, to freeze, and to forgive anyone, for anything. </p>
<p>So his palms became frost poisoned, and his forehead was frost infected. His every body part, once destroyed and tortured, reborn into frozen chilling energy absorbers, including every his flesh and bones. His mind can read the airs, and freeze and manipulate Chi. </p>
<p>He also drunk a lot, especially during the beginning of the breakout when he quaffed a 10-gallons barrel of whisky in only a day in order of his crippled arm and leg. Mayhaps he had choice, but rather to forget, freezing his body and pains with strong alcohols. Sometimes he can transform the fluids into alcohols if Chi linked. Until now, no one knew he does it how. </p>
<p>We could barely know all the background about him, until his exile time in the north lands. </p>
<p>In glacial cold winds, a mankind wore only a piece of cloth, or sheet, sit under a tree. With eyes closed, his look was calm. He should be painful, for his right arm seemed crippled and festered. The only anodyne could be the ceaseless gale of ice cold. “I am pretty lucky, at least my arm wasn’t cut loose, at least it’s right arm but not left arm. ” When he sit, his legs crossing, with right leg upper flipping upon the left one. </p>
<p>It has been more than 5 years, since his arm and leg was crippled, though his leg was healed. </p>
<p>“Now I should come back to the room. “ He lifted himself up a bit, before he stood up in the air, then, trampling. His eyes were still closed. Now, green colour airs around him gather into a sphere of Chi where he was inside. His body was fading, like snowflakes drifting, swirling inside the sphere, until his body disappeared. </p>
<p>Here was total darkness, as if there was a dark sun in the chamber. He was in the “room” of no lights. The atmosphere wasn’t fearful, but just peaceful. He found this place 5 years ago. He read this place everyday. This was his genesis of rebirth. He didn’t know who owns here. He didn’t know whether he has the permission. He never met anyone here. He didn’t even know what this place for. He didn’t know the time, let alone whether his usage was correct. He just came inside, and read it. He didn’t even know the actual geological location, which means, if he walks by foot, he hardly walks into this cave. </p>
<p>As if this place belongeth to him much earlier before he acknowledged this place, he read this place everyday. Mayhaps this place belongeth to him even before he was born? Born, tortured, if not killed once. Again, forget, freeze and forgive, under the realm of eternal ice. Aye, everyday is his warfare against temptations and frustrations. He only wanted to read this place, fortifying his mind. He only focuses on positive thoughts. He is the developer of inner true power. But he, again, even didn’t know what he had been doing. He just meditated and read, without knowing everything, day after day. </p>

Our answer to that question is no. To begin with, although killing is legal in our nations -which can extend to the killing of minds- individuals or firms can not distribute or make incentive motion, as a motion of killing of minds. Second, although the manufacturing and distributions are usually legal in terms of addiction drugs, the spread and incentive motions unto mass crowd are prohibited at the law. “ Then Edwin prompted, stopped. </p>
<p>“Sorry, Mr. Edwin, before you continue, I would like to acknowledge your hidden premise. How can you prove they are doing such motions, and what is the linkage? ”</p>
<p>“Absolutely, justice. In fact, we have all the evidences, as shown here. ”</p>
<p>Then Rudi throw all the networkings and gateway, along with his frozen Chi inside, unto the table of justice. The testimony is protected by the frost Chi, also. </p>
<p>“This, is… very remarkable. Do you have opinion? Sirs? ” Chief Justice said, looking at the defendant. </p>
<p>“No, justice. Not until now. ” The opposing lawyers maintain their silence onto the court, despite discussion in their team, anxiously. </p>
<p>“(whisper) I really want to say the third! And the fourth, and the fifth! ” Edwin said. </p>
<p>“Then we will lose this case. No, we only focus on their weakness. Let alone our testimony is perfect, irrefutable. “ Rudi replied. </p>
<p>“Oh man! I hate them! They should all go to hell! I will burn them! “</p>
<p>“Ok. Burn them outside the Court. ” Rudi blinked his eye, “for we are invincible here. “</p>

          <span itemprop="articleBody"><h1 id="Chapter-III-The-reunion"><a href="#Chapter-III-The-reunion" class="headerlink" title="Chapter III: The reunion"></a>Chapter III: The reunion</h1><p>The monk is on a horseback, raiding. Much warmer, and the sky is blue, but not purple as usual. </p>
<p>Tis different nation. But he remained his confidence in eyes, suggesting his former presence here. </p>
<p>The sun shined the robe. But unlike conventional robe -silky and light-colour- dark dirts upon it are the only thing drizzling. But this monk can’t care less.</p>
<p>“Ah, my nippy sweetie, here”</p>
<p>He stopped by in front of a large tree, confident and familiar. He gently swept the soil. Interestingly, the soil flipped and waved, until a cask showed. </p>
<p>He took out the cask from the soil, sniffing a bit around the rotating cask. </p>
<p>“Good enough” if not mumbling. </p>
<p>This cask looks heavy -and it’s large- not until the monk toyed it like this. </p>
<p>Then he roped the cask on his back, back to the journey. </p>
<p>He is used to dryness and coldness on the North. But it seems to him that he addapt this rather warmer and wetter airs much quicker. During the night -the time belongs to starts and moon- he let moon and stars shine upon his beaming while he sitting, calm and cold. You don’t know whether he slept or not. </p>
<hr>
<p>“Behold, your thing is too big to be allowed in the town.”</p>
<p>The other day, the guard for the gate stopped the monk.</p>
<p>“Greeting sir. But tis important. “</p>
<p>“Important for what? “</p>
<p>“Important for me to get in with my carry-on. “</p>
<p>“No. Layman. You can’t. You don’t listen. Take it off. Now. “</p>
<p>“Sorry sir. “ Then he leid down the cask.</p>
<p>“Take it in. You four. “</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>4 heaviest soldiers went to rope it, after that, they sought to lift it, until they couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Too heavy. Sir. “</p>
<p>“Then break it. “</p>
<p>“No, please. “ Rudi begged them, but they ignored. They prepared biggest hammers. 1-2-3, they drummed it, and again, and again, until the hammers split. </p>
<p>That’s strange, not only the robustness of the cask, but also the splits of the hammers- they seemed frozen.</p>
<p>“How dare you? Another unlicensed mage? Tie him. “</p>
<p>“Yes sir. “ Spellbreakers came out from the shadow - they are one of the fearful enemy for mage in this world. They can intervene and <em>devour</em> spells, metally torturing any caster in front of them, when magic chains in their hands.</p>
<p>“No please sir… “</p>
<p>“And you four, prepare enhanced siege tool to smash this crap. “</p>
<p>“Yes sir.”</p>
<p>Just as spellbreakers got near, with magic chains in hands, Rudi palmed right cheek of each spellbreaker in lightening speed. </p>
<p>“What? oh..”</p>
<p>Interestingly, they seemed paralysed, if not frozen.</p>
<p>“Shame on you. Killer! Try to kill all of us during the war time. How pethetic! “ The commander yelp.</p>
<p>“Ye art not dead, gentlemen. Let alone the fact that you attacked first. I will no trouble. “</p>
<p>“We are the justice. And you don’t abide by the law here. You don’t belong here. “</p>
<p>“Indeed you can define your justice. I am sorry again. But as I said, I will no trouble. “ Rudi replied.</p>
<p>“Sir we can’t break the cask with even +6 smashing machine. “</p>
<p>“This must be a conspiracy. You hide something from us. Mage. “</p>
<p>“Whatever you say sir. I want my time, and you play your bet. “</p>
<p>“Watch your words. Gambling is not allowed here.”</p>
<p>“Aye, not allowed here, for laymen like us, but not for you sirs. Every single day, you sirs gamble everything, such as my cask, for no reason. “</p>
<p>“I am the law. How dare you? Civilian. “</p>
<p>“Definitely. And I dare not, don’t get me wrong. I will no troubles. “ </p>
<p>“Your words don’t align with your actions. You hurt my people, and agitated me. “ </p>
<p>“I follow your judgement. But again, I want to have my time, and you have your bets and gambling. Peace. “</p>
<p>“My judgement is you should be put to death. “</p>
<p>“Everyday for me is dead. I am already dead, before frost soothed me. “</p>
<p>“You are too prideful. You dare to speak the nonsense before God. You have no God in your deceitful heart. “</p>
<p>“God said He will punish bad officials and princes, but not put His wrath upon us helpless civilians. “</p>
<p>“And you also slandered me, the law, saying us gamblers. “</p>
<p>“For I can read your mind. “</p>
<p>“Prideful pig. “</p>
<p>“Thank you. And I am leaving, with my keg indeed. “</p>
<p>“This guy calls this huge cask a keg. What’s wrong with his mind? “ a paralysed spellbreaker thought. </p>
<p>“Now, snipers. “</p>
<p>Just as the monk bowed, paused to move his foot, three bullets flied and stroke from his right side, unto his head.</p>
<p>The bullets were made of enhanced dark iron. This material is pretty dense, so as to accelerate the speed. </p>
<p>The monk doesn’t have time to dodge, let alone during bowing. Dark iron can transform into any most deadly weapons on the earth, let alone enhanced by magic. </p>
<p>However, no oozing, nor bleeding, as they indeed hit the target. The monk’s skin seemed to catch the three bullets, if not freeze them. </p>
<p>“Don’t stir the water. Just calm down. “ Rudi said, as his left hand grab all the bullets from his head. </p>
<p>And he tread, if not tremble the ground, before he breathes a deep green fog, around the air. The texture of the mist was not usual water, but something similar to alcohol, if not stronger than alcohol. And it smelled good, but freezing cold. </p>
<p>“Stupid.. bare-head.. willy.. “ the commander put. The soldiers, along with the commander, started disoriented, slowed down, and cool. </p>
<p>“Drink before you drive. Drive crazy not. Just calm and maintain. Gentleman. “ Rudi murmured to himself, for he knew nobody listening. </p>
<p>Then he rode on, with his huge “keg” carried on the back, as if nothing happened. Wind blew, freezing-cold.  </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Then he stopped by a lake, as if seeing something. </p>
<p>Warmer, heated, as the airs put. A large fireball rushed -he dodged not- onto the ground near him. He knew that. </p>
<p>“Well. It has been a long time. “</p>
<p>“Hey trashy monk. Why didn’t you die? “</p>
<p>“Ah I got our nice whisky. I distilled it with a keg made of iced pelatumba wood and soft mass-dense ironised coal, put it under the grillian tree. And you don’t want to know where the malt from. No kidding. “</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t want to know every your engineering shit. “</p>
<p>“Anyhow, prepare to enjoy your life now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my life is like shit. “ Edwin replied shortly, with his higher, energetic pitch. </p>
<p>“Don’t say that. Be positive. “ calmly, as Rudi opened the keg, collecting some golden fluid. </p>
<p>“You knew. Buddy. We are trash. “</p>
<p>“Don’t say that. We are good, at least right at this moment. “</p>
<p>“Fuck this world. I just feel…” Edwin said, as as the nip of Edwin’s share was warmed all at once. “ANGRY…”</p>
<p>“Aye, everyday can be frustrated. “ Rudi replied.</p>
<p>“It turns out that girl only wastes my time. Although she is cute, I don’t want to fuck her anymore. “ Edwin quaffed. “Oh fuck you stupid kid. This is too spicy too strong. “</p>
<p>“Sip, thou shalt, instead. Ha ha look at you. “ Rudi beamed, after he quaffed. </p>
<p>“You have no taste. Man. Why don’t you make wine or beer? “ Edwin said. </p>
<p>“Did you hear I brew wine or beer? Not to my ability. “ </p>
<p>“Anyway, that girl.. she is my type. Small in height, around 152 cm, big boobs, around 34F, and very hot and alluring in her traits, man, as she touched me, I got hard on! You knew my power and strength. Oh, I didn’t eject last night. What a shame. I feel really angry. “ </p>
<p>“Aye sometimes you just can’t. “</p>
<p>“I wanted to cum, but something wasn’t right last night. Her attitude. At the final posture -I went from her behind- I could tell she didn’t concentrate on our matter. What the hell. “</p>
<p>“Aye, bloody hell. “</p>
<p>“Yeah! She didn’t respect me, nor respect our love making. That’s.. frustrated. Women always disappoint me. What have I done, as every end of my relationship comes to this? “</p>
<p>“Do you love her? “ </p>
<p>“I like her body. Small body and big boobs, you knew. She is like a toy of my penis. I can control her solely by my penis and my magic. Inside her, my penis is so warm, greasy. She is wet too. All the time, even until she showed her reluctance, her pussy was wet as hell. And she is really cute, passionate. I also enjoyed her moaning. “</p>
<p>“Copulatory vocalisations. “</p>
<p>“Yeah, her moaning was like singing, rhymed by the root of my penis. My penis is the baton of the music, the authority of her small and fit body, and her vagina is my territory. “</p>
<p>“Ok. “</p>
<p>“But I didn’t cum. And I am not happy now. “</p>
<p>“Sip and forget. “</p>
<p>“Fuck that. Fuck that girl. And I don’t want to fuck her again. “</p>
<p>“Calm and forget. “ Rudi said onto the mage of rage. </p>
<p>Then the mage sipped, and made a deep breath, the plates on his chest moving, rhymed with his breath. </p>
<p>His plates look pretty robust, but not that heavy, at least to his movement eligible to the should-be-heavy plates. </p>
<p>“You see my ring and mace are still bright. So do my plates. I clean them everyday. I like heavy metals. “ </p>
<p>“By water? “</p>
<p>“No, by my cleanse spells. “</p>
<p>“Oh, you meant your flames. “</p>
<p>“Yeah. The surface and the solid should be treated in different processes. I got a lot of magic to do for their beauty. You knew, I concern the beauty the most. “</p>
<p>“Aye, you are the artist. “</p>
<p>“People thought I am a paladin by my plates when I am the better wizard. And in fact not only wizard I am but also an artist. “</p>
<p>“Whole world is my canvas, as you said. “</p>
<p>“That’s right! That’s who I am. That’s what I do! Oh man. But this world is a crap, especially after they came. “</p>
<p>“Ok. Sip. “</p>
<p>“Yeah. I like your beverage, soothing my heart always. But why you always brewed drink of such strong alcohol. This would just shade its beauty and flavour. You know nothing about arts. “</p>
<p>“Well. To my limit. “ The monk quaffed again, adding “I want to call this one The Frozen Heart. How do you like the name? “</p>
<p>“Whatever. But I don’t appreciate your old-school style of naming anyway. “</p>
<p>“Hah. High way to hell. “ Rudi replied with a smile. </p>
<p>“Hell of shit. “</p>
<p>“Bloody hell. “ coldly he mumbled. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>This was the other day of fogs. Cloudy a bit, but no rains in prospect. </p>
<p>“Dominating” Rudi said, as they watched the fighters among gladiators in an arena. They were slaves fighting for their freedom. Usually, it’s quite brutal. This nation has layers of layers for gladiators -or champions, whatever they say- and this game is not in the major leagues. </p>
<p>“You knew. If I were he, I fuck them with fire balls. Or just scorch them with my gazes and breath. “</p>
<p>“Aye I knew you would. “</p>
<p>“You can also put them in your storm of fists and legs. Man, you are the juicer. “</p>
<p>“I don’t know. “</p>
<p>“You already knew. You are the juicer, freezing them below zero, and blasting them into snowflakes. “ </p>
<p>“Ah. Ha ha. After all, we are the symphony of snows and flames. “ Rudi added, delightfully.</p>
<p>In this world, the reproduction of human kinds is pretty short, about only 6 months. So there are big populations among all the nations in this world, despite endless warfares recently, and constant combats as entertainment. Some competitions, especially in major leagues, have good magical protections upon the champions for their safety, for after all, they are freemen who fight for their ethnicity, group, company, guild, or even just for profits. But those slaves today don’t have that luck, though some of them have the potentials for advance in higher level, if they can walk out of the arena with full limbs. Yes, if one lost limbs, likely he’d not come back to the arena, let alone contracts between any team. </p>
<p>“So until now, for hours, where are they?! ”</p>
<p>“I thought they will come. ”</p>
<p>“Which they didn’t. You are wrong. ”</p>
<p>“We can enjoy the game, after all. ”</p>
<p>“Frustrated! I want some wine under Turtutoriotrits on the south after today’s boringness. ”</p>
<p>“Oh, I miss that place too. ”</p>
<p>“Yeah, one of best bars on the earth. Owned by some cool Tortollan guys. Their jokes and music are better than other bards and bartenders. ”</p>
<p>“Aye they really got that talent. Brev, I really want to be a tortollan. With that shell, I can do anything, at least I can join their cute league. ”</p>
<p>“No you can’t. Stupid. You are just a piece of monk, knowing nothing about arts. ”</p>
<p>“Aye, a piece of monk. ”</p>
<p>“We have pathetic lives, sitting here waiting for nothing. Even if we succeed catching the demons, no one would thank us, for they all have demonic hearts. They just say, OH YOU TWO ARE FREAKS. This is the truth of this fallen evil world. ”</p>
<p>“Aye, I remember last time, they said what the hell are ya? A monk in grubby gears, and a mage in stupid plates? And they kept saying that. Mayhaps this is their way of thanksgiving. ”</p>
<p>“And my weapons are mace and ring. I don’t give a shit of their comments. I am who I am. ” Edwin replied. </p>
<p>“Aye, you are the iron man, if not harder than iron. ”</p>
<p>“I am even harder when I am hard on. Indeed, I need a cute girl for the hard ignition. ”</p>
<p>“Before she ignites your sorrows after your sex. ”</p>
<p>“Oh man. You are totally right. ”</p>
<p>“Brilliant. ” </p>
<p>“And I hate that. ”</p>
<p>“Look. ”</p>
<p>Then one gladiator was mutilated by a deadly slash, as his arm flew thru the air, spreading blood everywhere, as the arteries were cut loose neatly. His opponent looked like a pretty good daggers swinger, while he is not stabbing type, but a slashing type, who uses tricky angle of dual daggers to cut flesh and bones neatly like scissors on the principle of leverage. This type of swordsman have agility and strength. </p>
<p>“As blood came out, temptation will arrive. “ Rudi commented, just as the crowd yelled and hailed ironically joyous, if not cruel. </p>
<p>“The people get me sick. ” Edwin sighed. </p>
<p>“Any blood, from vanguard or from sole entertainment, contributes the Thirsty. ”</p>
<p>“They can’t care less. “</p>
<p>The crowd yelled even louder. Some started to yelp, “Kill him. Kill him. This maggot should be eviscerated. ” “Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! “ They are passionate, happy, but ironically hateful, as they breathed such words in joyous manners. They didn’t know why, but they are more than normal. Maybe some of them thought this is just for fun. Let alone judging people is always more than fun. </p>
<p>Who are the audiences? They are good-behavioured and educated civilians, most of them are scholars, bankers or top businessmen in this town -no everyone can afford the price of a game in arena, let alone donations usually mandatory- but when they were in situation like this, they always showed such kind of traits. Perhaps this is just a nature of human, blood thirsty, as people kept denying on their education systems. And now, some warlock agency takes advantage of this human nature for their profits. Again, warlocks are also decent professions in this age. Decent people always have decent way to collect the dirtiest money. </p>
<p>“But I am not swallowing it. I am angry. “ Edwin said. </p>
<p>“I knew. But we need evidence. That’s why we are here. ”</p>
<p>“Yeah I knew. I am the lawyer. But I want to burn them after I humiliate them in the court. ”</p>
<p>“Aye we can. ”</p>
<p>“Fuck them. ” Edwin said. </p>
<p>In the academia of the magic, there are 7 orthodox schools in classical, or old school, classification. They are, Adjuration for protecting, Conjuration for Summoning, Divination for detecting, Enchantment for controlling, Evocation for element arts, Illustration for imaging, Necromancy for life manipulations. That’s why we usually said a good mage is a “Master of Seven Arts”. In a more modern classification, some universities divide the knowledge body of magic into Fire, Ice, Arcane, Lightening, Chaos, in lieu of old-school 7 arts system, for combat pragmatism -or so-called specialisations system- such that trainee can focus on one. </p>
<p>“You knew. I am a genius of fire. I casted my first fireball when I was two years old. Usually, even academical genius learn to control the fire after their 18. ” Edwin shared.</p>
<p>“Aye you said that before. ”</p>
<p>“And you knew what? All the mage educations are pussy. I am the hard on, so I do no pussy, despite attending Omegamanism University, best magical university in the world we know. Finally I came out a way to cast magic from my fury and wrath -I call it my rage system- but not any more from concentration system that conventional people use. That was pathetic system. ”</p>
<p>“And you focus on fire. ”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Any other specialisation is just toy to me. “</p>
<p>“At least not to your talent, for you are the fire guy. And you wear plates. “</p>
<p>“That’s right. I am the fire guy. I can visualise my emotion, evoking them into actual fires and flames. And I wear plates. I am awesome. ”</p>
<p>“Aye, thou art. “</p>
<p>“They do evading, blinking, wanding that kind of crap. I got my fire dash. I use my Force and my Fire. F&amp;F. ”</p>
<p>“Aye you are one of the best wizards. And you marched your own path. You can’t care less about Master of Seven Arts. ”</p>
<p>“Because I am better than they. “</p>
<p>“You are the iron man who melts the enemy. “</p>
<p>“That’s right! That’s who I am! And it’s an irony that body of mage is fragile when mage still insists to wear clothes rather than plates. They train no their buts, having no brains. ”</p>
<p>“But I knew you can’t endure attacks, even if you wear plates. “</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, you are my cover. You read, shade and heal pains and attacks for me, as I cleanse the offenders. “</p>
<p>“They are nothing before you. You don’t need endurance. You just hurt them and destroy them. ”</p>
<p>“That’s right. That’s who I am. “ Edwin said proudly. </p>
<p>Now that the monk read a pretty offensive draining force in the airs, perhaps due to some warlock’s Business Curse, as it collected <em>Thirsty</em> energy. The conversion rate of energy storage wasn’t good enough at this time. But this field of study already attracted the eyes of many seed investors, for the early adapters also thought the Thirsty Energy Transformed Magical Storage is a big plus for their lives as well as their careers. If the business practitioners -the warlocks- can grow their business and sell it, it’s a good business model no matter what. They can’t care less about the conversion rate and the pragmatism, if their ideas are brilliant product market fit. </p>
<p>“They are doing it,” said the monk.</p>
<p>“And we are stopping them,” replied the mage. </p>
