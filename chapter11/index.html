You thought you can forgive. How about your own survival? ” Edwin said.””<br>“Aye. “ Rudi.<br>“You thought you can handle that. Sometimes you thought you can heal them. No, you not, but just cost your own life. ”Edwin continued, “You really should have your own family, in lieu of extending your love whimsically. ” Edwin put and concluded.<br>“O why are you always so wise. ” Rudi.<br>“For I burn and cleanse. ” as Edwin joked, he continued “You really need. You have to. ”<br>“Mayhaps.” Rudi quaffed another nip of whisky. </p>
<p>Here is the bar under water, supported by magic of torsollans. The owners were Leonardo, Donatello, Michelingelo, and Raphael. They were ninjas before they retired and owned this bar. They were all good bartenders, though both Rudi and Edwin didn’t bought any cocktails. O, maybe Rudi’s scotch could be regarded as a “blended cocktail before distillery”? </p>
<p>They drank cup after cup, bottle after bottle, until the sunrise in the other day. </p>
<p>“Look at that. You are drunk. ” Rudi put.<br>“No I didn’t! “ Edwin said.<br>“Hah ha. Look at you. ” Rudi.<br>“No no, I don’t. Buddy. ” as Edwin said, he snored, happened put his left hand his finger hand in front of his mouth, breathed a fire.<br>“Woh woh woh. Hey! Gentlemen! ” Raphael said.<br>“Edwin, don’t burn our small piece of ma and pa, ok? ” Leonardo added.<br>Then Leonardo, Donatello, Michelingelo, Raphael, Rudi and Edwin all laughed. </p>
<p>“You know your problem? “ Edwin continued, “your grandpa. Your code of love, care and forgive. But our world is not that clean, but filthy. So you need continuously lie to yourself. You love even your enemies when they want to hurt you. You can read the airs, but you let others cheat you, for you lie to yourself and justify their evildoings. “<br>“You are talking about subconsciousness. “ Rudi said.<br>“And I won’t let them control, bother, hurt and burden me, if I were you. “ Edwin continued, “I would cleanse my problems with flames. I save myself before saving others. Let alone someone you cannot save due to their own decisions. “ </p>
<p>“So what’s your problem, Edwin?” said Donatello.<br>“We want to find someone. ” said Edwin.<br>“You who? ” said Donatello.<br>“Sadly, we don’t know. ” Edwin.<br>“Hmm. Interesting. ” Donatello.<br>“A dragon claimed an identity unto Edwin, and deceived an important possession. Unto same location, where he claimed to be a king, we found him not. They’re gone, both our thing and this guy. ” Rudi.<br>“Dragons? They are usually deceitful. Everybody knows, especially when they thought cheating on human kinds no big deal. “ Donatello.<br>“And we got to find our thing. ” Rudi.<br>“What kind of thing? “ Donatello.<br>“A shoulderguard. ”Rudi. </p>
<p>Then Donatello ruminated. said Wiping the cup, Michelingelo added, “usually, when a dragon got a thing from you, you can’t trace it back. ”. Leonardo then said, “In fact, Raphael also lost a thing from dragons. For decades, you had found it til we faced the reality. ”</p>
<p>Michelingelo said, “man, they are socerers, if not powerful then them. They had skins and armours. They casted magic, yet required no casting time, unlike human-kind mages. You could kill them, but well, they are tough guys. ”</p>
<p>Donatello said, “their invasions were thru-o history of human kind. The origin of eastern new year was also due to them. You know, they were no folklores. They were true stories. Nians killed and ate children for snacks. Human kinds don’t eat young monkeys for snacks, for monkeys are smart and have emotions. But for dragons, they can’t care less. Eat eat eat. Cheat cheat cheat. They thought everything belongs to them. ”</p>
<p>Rudi said, “my friend can cast spells instantly, and he wears artefact armours. I guard him, as he fires, all of dragons burn. “<br>Leonardo said, “sounds like a plan. Hah. “</p>
<p>Rudi then approached to a girl, saying, “your eyes are not jewellery, are they? “<br>The girl laughed, answered, “well. This line is not impressive. “<br>“This is not a line, but an objective observation. “ Rudi.<br>“Whoa? Are you kidding me? “ said the girl.<br>“Rudi. “ said Rudi.<br>“Seraphine. “ said the girl.<br>“Good name but long, like your hairs. “ said Rudi.<br>“What brings you here? “ said Seraphine.<br>“Wind. “ Rudi nodded, “cold wind in eternal ice. “<br>“Ah… “ Seraphine.<br>“Not yet in Seraphine’s eyes. “ Rudi put.<br>“O… “<br>“So what do you drink, tonight? “ Rudi.<br>“Burning Insects juice, I guess? “ Seraphine.<br>“That’s sweet, right, Leonardo? Not a pro in cocktails, let alone your profound naming system. “ yelled Rudi.<br>“Definitely. Why don’t you try even one in our bar. You are boring, ordering the same whisky all the time. “ Leonardo.<br>“No. I won’t. “ yelled Rudi, then he told unto Seraphine in his usual low, cold voice, “alright. I just want to say your eyes are petty. Nice to see them. “<br>“Well. Thank you. “ Seraphine put, eyeing on Rudi continuously.</p>
<p>Rudi got back seat. Edwin said, “are you kidding me? What are you doing. “<br>“That’s enough. I just want to say thanks, for her eyes brighten my night. “ replied Rudi.<br>“Come on! “ said Edwin, “ she’s interested in you! “<br>“No she doesn’t. And whatever. “ said Rudi. Then they talked about all kind of things, such as work, missions, memories. Also they talked to the owners of the bar. They tortollans were pretty old. </p>
<p>Later, the girl approached him, “you are kind of funny. What you do? “<br>“We are finding a dragon, or a group of dragons. “ said Rudi, “yet we still did nothing, til we have clues. “</p>
<p>“What for? They are rogues. “ she said.<br>“Our item was deceived, “ said Rudi.<br>“No change for you to take back. “<br>“Did you hear any dragons, occasionally? “<br>“I am not sure. “<br>“Are you a resident here? “<br>“Yes, I live here since I was born. “<br>“How old are you? “<br>“25. “<br>“15 years younger than I. “<br>“Really. You look young. “<br>“Don’t bald, moustache look old? “<br>“No but look cold. Like you said, you were brought by cold winds. “<br>“Well but thou art starting melting me. “<br>“Actually I am a Druid. “<br>“So you know instinct. “<br>“A bit. “<br>“You prefer instinct or fate? “<br>“Why? “<br>“I meditate every night for our thing. “<br>“Oh come on. What so important? And you have no chance. “<br>“Summon your flame blade. “<br>“What?! “<br>“Summon. Try me. “ Rudi said.<br>Then the girl smiled, beamed, as if been flirted. She hesitated a second, “alright. “ then she was summoning the fire element, a very important spell in so-called equilibrium arts, before structuring any so-called the wraths of nature. Then she formed the element into a flame blade unto her beautiful brown meticulously amber-like right hand.<br>“Pretty… “ said Rudi.<br>Then the girl stroke him with the blade, smiling. That’s a big but artless blow, for she predicted Rudi to dodge, while he didn’t. The blade cut thru the body. “Oh… sorry. “ she was shocked, but right in another second, she was shocked even worse. Her blade was frozen for some reason. What? Impossible.<br>“…Much. “ said Rudi, “I like your hand. “ Rudi continued to tease the girl, “jewellery eyes, amber-like hand… anything else beautiful? “<br>“How can it be… flame blade is one of the most destructive and stable weapon in my wrath of nature. Let alone it cannot be dispelled. “ said the girl, trembling.<br>“Now, may we have a chance, “ Rudi paused, “… against dragons? “ said Rudi. The girl was stunned, also stunning, so he got the girl with one big step closer. He stopped, gently, yet firmly, kissing her forehead, as he couldn’t help himself. He continued, coldly and lowly, “You smell good. “<br>He paused again, “so, did you really not hear anything related to dragons? “<br>“Actually, I… “ the girl nervously stammered, “acknowledged a clan of dragons here. Not precisely, I meant. Wait… Let me think. “<br>Idled Rudi, smiling.<br>Then she continued, “you are really strange. “<br>With beam wore, Rudi coked a bit, “You are strange, too. ”</p>
<p>Suddenly, didn’t know why, Rudi recalled, or even missed, his ex-wife. They were together for more than 8 years. Before she left her, she said, Have been unhappy for many years with you the wrong guy, while Rudi didn’t know any single sign. After she left him for 3 months, she said unto him, I have been seeing someone else now, good bye Rudi, focus on yourself. Yet how could Rudi focus on his hollow self? </p>
<p>He hoped her everything fine, yet still felt painful, for he loved her so much, so deep, more than himself. She commented their relationship as “Wicked Love”, and he didn’t know why. He tried his best to complement her, comfort her, even in arguments. But it turned out, those were just perfunctory communications in her sights and ears. </p>
<p>Maybe, to her, he is just someone who didn’t know the art of words, and no reason for this to work out. Let alone she threatened him occasionally, and sued him. Still, full of sweet memory were in his minds. To Rudi, sourness cannot bury sweeties. Apparently, her ex-partner had different opinion. After all, he knew she forgot him as she said, yet he still occasionally recalled her, or missed her, like this moment. </p>
<p>“Hey, are you okay? ” said Seraphine.<br>“I don’t know. “ said Rudi. </p>
